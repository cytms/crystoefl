Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\u2019s Advanced Imaging & Visualization Laboratory, a world leader in underwater imaging, developed special 3-D and 2-D cameras for the mission that delivered high-quality footage of extreme clarity. The Waitt Institute for Discovery, meanwhile, supplied self-controlled robots known as AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles), capable of independently surveying the site with high-resolution side-scan sonar. These devices worked in tandem with an ROV (remote operated vehicle) provided by Phoenix International, a marine services contractor.\nThe National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Park Service\u2019s Submerged Resources Center and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M University also contributed to the expedition. Titanic technical experts Parks Stephenson and Bill Sauder, marine artist Ken Marschall and accident investigator Jim Chiles served as consultants on behalf of HISTORY.\nTogether, the expedition\u2019s participants generated a map that was not only more complete but also more precise than earlier attempts. \u201cOver the course of time, there have been dozens of expeditions to Titanic, but notwithstanding all of the expertise and all of the technological advances, no one has even tried to accomplish creating a comprehensive site survey map of this wreck site,\u201d said Chris Davino, president of RMS Titanic, Inc. \u201cPrevious expeditions have gone down in manned submersibles or photo sleds to cover an area of the wreck site,\u201d Stephenson explained. \u201cThey would only cover a portion of the wreck site since they could only stay down for so long.\u201d When experts fused together these disparate slices back on the surface, key information was lost\u2014including the exact locations of artifacts and fragments.\nThe AUVs, which had never before been used on a shipwreck site, traveled the entire search area and returned with high-resolution views that were aggregated into a sonar map. The second step of the process involved sending out an ROV fitted with cameras to debris-rich sites pinpointed by the AUVs. \u201cThe sonar map is the baseline for the entire analysis,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cIt basically shows us the truth of where all of the debris landed, and then we used that as a guide to go through all of the raw footage. This gave us eyeball resolution on all those pieces, including pieces we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d David Gallo, director of special projects at Woods Hole, described the footage captured by the ROV: \u201cThe images are staggering. There you are on the bottom of the ocean, transported to the sea floor. It\u2019s mindboggling; even veterans who have been to Titanic numerous times are slack-jawed.\u201d\nThe team believes its cutting-edge approach represents a paradigm shift in underwater archaeology. \u201cSpeaking as an archeologist, I think it\u2019s extremely exciting,\u201d said James Delgado, director of maritime heritage for NOAA\u2019s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. \u201cThis technology and these AUVs are as much a game changer for this kind of work on the bottom as going from a landline to a Blackberry.\u201d Davino said it filled a longstanding void in research on the illustrious wreck. \u201cSo much of what we\u2019re doing really hasn\u2019t been done before,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe map itself, obviously, is a first-time-ever product. People have been clamoring for this on Titanic for literally decades.\u201d\nIn addition to offering a detailed look at critical elements of the wreckage\u2014including the dual surfaces of the hull\u2019s double bottom, a focus of a 2006 HISTORY special on Titanic\u2014the mapping project revealed new and telling pieces experts knew little or nothing about. For instance, a pile of unidentified rubble, which Stephenson and other HISTORY analysts dubbed the \u201cdeckhouse debris,\u201d turned out to encompass the base of Titanic\u2019s third funnel and surrounding decks. \u201cThis gave us our first indication of how the ship actually broke apart,\u201d Stephenson said of the piece, which he\u2019d glimpsed in outtakes from the 2006 special. \u201cIt\u2019s important not only to identify what things were but also to establish a context for them.\u201d\nBy taking into account the locations of the deckhouse debris, the double bottom and newly discovered pieces on the sonar map, investigators recreate the ship\u2019s final moments\u2014in particular its deterioration and descent to the sea floor\u2014in \u201cTitanic at 100: Mystery Solved.\u201d \u201cYou really begin to understand how violently the ship tore itself apart when it went down and landed all over this enormous footprint on the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said David Alberg, sanctuary superintendent for NOAA\u2019s Monitor National Marine Sanctuary. Filmmaker Rushmore DeNooyer, a producer of the HISTORY special, likened the undertaking to a forensic analysis of a crime or disaster scene\u2014only in this case, 100 years after the tragedy took place. \u201cIf the National Transportation Safety Board looks at an airliner that crashes or if NASA looks at the Space Shuttle Columbia accident, they look at where the pieces are and how they are arranged and oriented on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically like the map.\u201d\nIn keeping with this theme, \u201cTitanic at 100: Mystery Solved\u201d features a segment in which computer simulations enact the sinking in reverse, bring pieces of Titanic\u2019s wreckage back to the surface and reassemble the ship in a \u201cvirtual hangar.\u201d The aim is to determine how and why the ship\u2019s structure failed when it split apart, as well as where exactly the break occurred. \u201cBecause of the comprehensive mapping from the 2010 expedition, we were able for the first time to reconstruct that broken middle area of the ship,\u201d said Stephenson.\nAmong other hypotheses about Titanic\u2019s sinking, the new analysis challenges the theory that Titanic didn\u2019t break from the top down, as depicted in popular movies, but rather from the bottom up. It also investigates the widely held assumption that Titanic, famously touted as \u201cunsinkable,\u201d suffered from a fatal engineering flaw. A number of potential culprits have come under fire over the years, from the steel that encased the ship to the rivets that held it together. Did a fundamental weakness lurk beneath the grandeur of Titanic, as so many have suggested? How state-of-the-art was the liner for its time? What was the role of human error in Titanic\u2019s demise, and who was to blame? \u201cTitanic at 100: Mystery Solved\u201d will explore these and other issues as experts work to put the mythic ship to rest once and for all.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"First Map of Entire Titanic Wreck Site Sheds New Light on Disaster","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/titanic-map-150x150.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/first-map-of-entire-titanic-wreck-site-sheds-new-light-on-disaster"}
