{"summary":"Oviraptor tails were also extremely muscular, and, according to fossil impressions, had a fan of feathers at the end. In Persons\u2019 view, oviraptors could very well have used their muscular, flexible tails to wave their feathers in order to impress potential mates, just as peacocks use their magnificent jewel-toned feathers in courtship displays today.","advice_category":"1","content":"\nNow, scientist have uncovered another fascinating link between the oviraptor and today\u2019s birds. At the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology\u2019s annual meeting on November 2, 2011 in Las Vegas, doctoral student Scott Persons of the University of Alberta presented new findings about the oviraptor\u2019s tail and how it might have been used. The dense arrangement of the bones in the tail was unusual even among theropods (which are the group of dinosaurs most closely related to modern-day birds) and allowed it to move with greater flexibility.\nOviraptor tails were also extremely muscular, and, according to fossil impressions, had a fan of feathers at the end.
