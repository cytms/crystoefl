{"summary":"Patrick wore a color known as St. On St","advice_category":"1","content":"\nSt. Patrick was Irish.\nThough one of Ireland\u2019s patron saints, Patrick was born in what is now England, Scotland or Wales\u2014interpretations vary widely\u2014to a Christian deacon and his wife, probably around the year 390. According to the traditional narrative, at 16 he was enslaved by Irish raiders who attacked his home; they transported him to Ireland and held him captive there for six years. Patrick later fled to England, where he received religious instruction before returning to Ireland to serve as a missionary.\nSt. Patrick was British.\nHis birthplace doesn\u2019t mean Patrick was a Brit, however\u2014at least not technically. During his lifetime the British Isles were occupied by the Romans, a group that included Patrick\u2019s parents and thus the saint himself. It is unknown whether his family\u2014thought to have been part of the Roman aristocracy\u2014was of indigenous Celtic descent or hailed from modern-day Italy. When Patrick penned the two surviving documents attributed to him, he wrote in Latin and signed his name \u201cPatricius,\u201d but according to some accounts he was born Maewyn Succat.\nSt. Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland.\nIn 431, before Patrick began preaching in Ireland, Pope Celestine reportedly sent a bishop known as Palladius \u201cto the Irish believing in Christ\u201d\u2014an indication that some residents of the Emerald Isle had already converted by then. One theory holds that the St. Patrick of lore is actually an amalgam of two men: Palladius and the deacon\u2019s son who first visited Ireland as a slave.\nSt. Patrick banished snakes from the Emerald Isle.\nLegend has it that Patrick stood on an Irish hillside and delivered a sermon that drove the island\u2019s serpents into the sea. While it\u2019s true that the Emerald Isle is mercifully snake-free, chances are that\u2019s been the case throughout human history. Water has surrounded Ireland since the end of the last glacial period, preventing snakes from slithering over; before that, it was blanketed in ice and too chilly for the cold-blooded creatures. Scholars believe the snake story is an allegory for St. Patrick\u2019s eradication of pagan ideology.\nGreen has historically been associated with St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\nThe Irish countryside may be many shades of green, but knights in the Order of St. Patrick wore a color known as St. Patrick\u2019s blue. Why did green become so emblematic of St. Patrick that people began drinking green beer, wearing green and, of course, dyeing the Chicago River green to mark the holiday he inspired? The association probably dates back to the 18th century, when supporters of Irish independence used the color to represent their cause.\nPopular St. Patrick\u2019s Day festivities have their roots in Ireland.\nUntil the 1700s, St. Patrick\u2019s Day was a Roman Catholic feast only observed in Ireland\u2014and without the raucous revelry of today\u2019s celebrations. Instead, the faithful spent the relatively somber occasion in quiet prayer at church or at home. That started to change when Irish immigrants living in the United States began organizing parades and other events on March 17 as a show of pride. For many people around the world, St. Patrick\u2019s Day has evolved into a secular ode to Irish culture (or at least an oversimplified version of it), characterized by parties, music and iconic foods.\nCorned beef is a classic St. Patrick\u2019s Day dish.\nOn St. Patrick\u2019s Day, countless merrymakers in the United States, Canada and elsewhere savor copious plates of corned beef and cabbage. In Ireland, however, a type of bacon similar to ham is the customary protein on the holiday table. In the late 19th century, Irish immigrants in New York City\u2019s Lower East Side supposedly substituted corned beef, which they bought from their Jewish neighbors, in order to save money. That\u2019s not to say salt-cured beef isn\u2019t a traditional Irish dish; pork, however, has historically been more widely available on the Emerald Isle.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"St. Patrick\u2019s Day Myths Debunked","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/st-patricks-day-boston.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/st-patricks-day-myths-debunked"}
