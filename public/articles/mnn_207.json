We last saw him eschewing sleep to save his city from Hurricane Sandy. He turned his home into a temporary crash pad for neighbors who had no electricity, and then he managed to finagle free Hot Pockets for his constituents who were in need of a frozen fast-food fix.\n\n\t?\n\n\tAnd now the good mayor is setting out to try life on food stamps.\n\n\t?\n\n\tThe Twitter-obsessed Booker tweeted that investing in schools and nutrition would save money in the long run, instead of paying only for \u201chuge back-end\u201d government programs.?But when Twitter follower, TwitWit \u2014 a self-described \u201cDaughter of the American Revolution (DAR), fighting against any and all forms of socialism/communism\u201d \u2013?responded?that \u201cnutrition is not a responsibility of the government,\u201d Booker, true to form, had to engage.\n\n\t?\n\n\n\t\tAfter a bit of back and forth about?the topic of?nutrition, the mayor challenged TwitWit to experience what people on food stamps are going through. \u201cWe have a shared responsibility that kids go to school nutritionally ready 2 learn,\u201d?Booker tweeted. \u201cLets you and I try to live on food stamps in New Jersey (high cost of living) and feed a family for a week or month. U game?\u201d\n\n\n\t?\n\n\tTwitWit agreed, and we happily await the mayoral tweets that will undoubtedly recount the experience, and turn it into a simple yet profound lesson for all who follow.
