The python puncher said she was trying to save the kitten, which she\u2019s named Tuffy, from the same fate as its mother.  Its mother, Coco, had been squeezed to death just days before Tuffy\u2019s attack. It\u2019s unknown whether the same python was responsible.\nButterworth said: \"It was almost dark and I saw this silhouette coming down, and I knew what was about to happen to Tuffy. Here was this evil thing coming out of the fence, coming down, and within a couple of seconds it had the cat.\"\nTry as she might to get little Tuffy back to safety, the kitten was oblivious to the danger and ignored her calls before it was attacked.\n\"I just started punching the thick part of the snake where it was about the size of my arm. I wasn't looking, I just kept punching until it let go,\u201d said Butterworth.\nAfter the battle, the snake slithered away. Butterworth then realized she\u2019d been hurt in the scuffle. For her heroic kitten saving efforts, she suffered a broken wrist and several bites from the snake.\nSource: News.com.au\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers' choice awards.
