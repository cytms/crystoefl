The red rose signified his opposition to the proposed 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which stated that \u201c[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\u201d By the summer of 1920, 35 states had ratified the measure, bringing it one vote short of the required 36. In Tennessee, it had sailed through the Senate but stalled in the House of Representatives, prompting thousands of pro- and anti-suffrage activists to descend upon Nashville. If Burn and his colleagues voted in its favor, the 19th Amendment would pass the final hurdle on its way to adoption.\nAfter weeks of intense lobbying and debate within the Tennessee legislature, a motion to table the amendment was defeated with a 48-48 tie. The speaker called the measure to a ratification vote. To the dismay of the many suffragists who had packed into the capitol with their yellow roses, sashes and signs, it seemed certain that the final roll call would maintain the deadlock. But that morning, Harry Burn\u2014who until that time had fallen squarely in the anti-suffrage camp\u2014received a note from his mother, Phoebe Ensminger Burn, known to her family and friends as Miss Febb. In it, she had written, \u201cHurrah, and vote for suffrage! Don\u2019t keep them in doubt. I notice some of the speeches against. They were bitter. I have been watching to see how you stood, but have not noticed anything yet.\u201d She ended the missive with a rousing endorsement of the great suffragist leader Carrie Chapman Catt, imploring her son to \u201cbe a good boy and help Mrs. Catt put the \u2018rat\u2019 in ratification.\u201d\nStill sporting his red boutonniere but clutching his mother\u2019s letter, Burn said \u201caye\u201d so quickly that it took his fellow legislators a few moments to register his unexpected response. With that single syllable he extended the vote to the women of America and ended half a century of tireless campaigning by generations of suffragists, including Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, Lucy Burns and, of course, Mrs. Catt. (\u201cTo get the word \u2018male\u2019 in effect out of the Constitution cost the women of this country 52 years of pauseless campaign,\u201d Catt wrote in her 1923 book, \u201cWoman Suffrage and Politics.\u201d) He also invoked the fury of his red rose-carrying peers while presumably avoiding that of his mother\u2014which may very well have been the more daunting of the two.\nThe next day, Burn defended his last-minute reversal in a speech to the assembly. For the first time, he publicly expressed his personal support of universal suffrage, declaring, \u201cI believe we had a moral and legal right to ratify.\u201d But he also made no secret of Miss Febb\u2019s influence\u2014and her crucial role in the story of women\u2019s rights in the United States. \u201cI know that a mother\u2019s advice is always safest for her boy to follow,\u201d he explained, \u201cand my mother wanted me to vote for ratification.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"The Mother Who Saved Suffrage: Passing the 19th Amendment","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mother-who-saved-suffrage-wide.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/the-mother-who-saved-suffrage-passing-the-19th-amendment"}
