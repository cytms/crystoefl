If you feel like writing for us, drop us an email!\nIt was pretty much guaranteed that, with the millions and millions of animal species in existence, some of them were going to be really, really weird. The ocean, in particular, is a veritable treasure trove of ugly, strange, and downright inexplicable creatures. We\u2019ve left the seas out of it for the time being, that\u2019s a whole other post, but even without the water we\u2019ve found some pretty incredible creatures. Here are our picks for the 5 freakiest creatures on Earth:\n5. The Bonobo\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly physically strange about the Bonobo (Pan paniscus). They\u2019re essentially slightly smaller versions of your basic chimpanzee. What makes the Bonobo so unique is its rather, ahem, unique mating  habits. Bonobos are, and I\u2019m speaking scientifically here, the horniest little monkeys in the world. Sex is used for, well, everything, including being used as a greeting, a means of both ending fights and making nice afterwards, and as a favor in exchange for food by females. And lest you think this is normal, everyday monkey sex, let me assure you, it\u2019s not. Bonobos are the only ape, besides humans of course,  which engage in: the missionary position (in order of popularity, face-to-face sex is generally female on female, male female, then male-male), tongue kissing (yes, monkey\u2019s are frenching), and oral sex. And just in case you\u2019re still taking this article in any way seriously, scientists who study Bonobos often refer to male-male sex between Bonobos as \u201cpenis fencing\u201d. All this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Bonobo sex. In spite of our intense desire to really, truly, educate our readers on this most serious of issues, however, we\u2019ll leave it at that. For seeing more, and kinkier, action than most San Francisco bathhouses, we\u2019re making the Bonobo our number 5 freakiest(in every way) creature.\n4. The Kakapo\nNew Zealand is full of messed up feathered beasts. For instance, the Kea, the world\u2019s only mountainous parrot, is known as the \"feathered wolf\" for its murderous disposition. The Kakapo (Strigops Habroptilus) is less dangerous but far more hilarious. The Kakapo is also known as the Owl Parrot, and is the heaviest parrot in the world. It is both nocturnal and flightless, although it seems to be unaware of the latter. The BBC lists one scientist\u2019s fond remembrance of the bird which we think sums up the creature nicely: 1. It was too fat to be able to fly. 2. It was too dumb to remember it couldn\u2019t fly. 3. It would spread its wings and fall like a brick.\n3.The Star-Nosed Mole\nWhile perhaps having a less colorful back story than some of the other animals on this list, the Star-Nosed Mole makes up for it in general ickyness of appearance. The Condylura cristata is easily recognized by its namesake nasal appendages. Their noses are incredibly sensitive, and are covered in almost 100,000 tiny touch receptors called Eimer\u2019s Organs, which are thought to possibly allow them to detect electrical activity in other animals. Their noses don\u2019t grow like normal animal appendages, but start as swellings around the nose before bursting through and moving forward much like a peeled banana. They\u2019re also known as the world\u2019s fastest eating mammal, with the ability to identify and consume a food item in 120 milliseconds. They can also smell underwater by exhaling, then re-inhaling, air bubbles through the back of the nose.\n2 The Platypus\nLists are often very subjective, with a lot of people who read them disagreeing with the order or inclusion of the things on the list. In a weird animals list, however, the platypus remains a constant. There\u2019s just something inherently unbelievable about a creature that, when a corpse was studied by an English museum shortly after its discovery, was dismissed as a poor attempt at a hoax. The Platypus or (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is a mammal, but it lays eggs. It is poisonous, and with its duck\u2019s bill, beaver tail, and feet and body like an otter, it looks like something that could only resulted as some sort of drunken bet by God.\n1. The Aye-Aye\nThe Aye-Aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is a particularly odd looking primate native to Madagascar. The world\u2019s largest nocturnal primate, this evil looking bad boy sports a long tail, rodent-like teeth, and, with its freakishly long middle finger, is the natural world\u2019s most prepared creature for L.A. driving. Local superstitions attributes extremely deadly power to the animal. They\u2019re held to frequently sneak into houses at night and murder the occupants. That creepy middle finger, especially, has its own powers. If an aye-aye points its middle digit at someone, that person is thought to be doomed to death. Unsurprisingly, the local villagers frequently kill the aye-aye, and it is now an endangered species. As the only animal we know of capable of flicking you off to death, we\u2019re rating the Aye-Aye as the world\u2019s weirdest animal.\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"The World's 5 Freakiest Creatures","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/1b_tardigrade_in_space.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/5-freakiest-creatures/341"}
