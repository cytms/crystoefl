Faint lassos of spittle unfurl through the air, tribute to the ferocity of the fight; a torn ear testament to past battles. It beats photographer Julian Robinson how these battling beasts survive such encounters, but survive they do. Male kangaroos are known for their pugilistic prowess and they share a boxer's upright stance and combat skills. Bouncing nimbly on powerful hind legs, sizing each other up, the two opponents launch sudden combinations, jabbing and grappling with lightning forelegs to gain the advantage, then lashing out with raking kicks \u2013 haymakers far more devastating than any man's. Each razorsharp hind claw has the potential to disembowel the other animal. It's as well each kangaroo's organs are protected by tough skin and a thick layer of abdominal tissue. When these body blows land, the loud thumps are like the beating of a tribal drum. \nPhoto: Julian Robinson\nAlthough far from unfamiliar with Australia\u2019s Eastern Grey Kangaroos, Julian Robinson was quite unprepared for the spectacle that was to unravel before his eyes. He stumbled upon the slugfest in 2006, \u201cwhile I was with a car full of Greening Australia people, doing a photo series for World Environment Day,\u201d he told Environmental Graffiti. \u201cWe'd come to a property [about 20km north-west of Canberra, ACT] to look at some tree plantings and take some photos.\u201d What he captured on his camera was an incident far more impressive \u2013 and brutal \u2013 than even the most gnarly of saplings!\nPhoto: Julian Robinson\n\u201cAs we drove up I saw the roos ahead on a rise and asked the others to stay in the car,\u201d says Julian. \u201cI jumped out of the car and ran up to them behind cover of some trees. Then I had to break cover to take the photos. One of the roos saw me, took a quick look at me and was considering scampering off when the other one caught him unawares and biffed him hard enough to almost knock him off his feet. The fight was back on and they ignored me totally for the rest of the time.\u201d\nThe dangerous forepaw claws are clearly visible in the first two shots above. \u201cThey keep their heads out of range as far as they can, with good reason,\u201d explains Julian, adding: \u201cYou don't see many roos standing up tall. These guys sure got as high as they could get.\u201d Laws of nature. Needs must. \nPhoto: Julian Robinson\nSometimes the kangaroos engage in these bouts with one another playfully or for practice, but often, as Julian explains, \u201cit's all about male dominance, and a contest for 'owning' the group of females. Standard old bull vs young bull stuff.\u201d Standard maybe, but there's nothing run of the mill about witnessing the phenomenon first hand. At peak mating season, competition can be fierce among the big males if there is not a high enough proportion of 'sheila' kangaroos coming into heat.\nThe so-called boxing is kangaroos' natural defensive behaviour. Still, observing the way that they hold attackers in place with their 'arms' and kick out with hind legs whose claws can slash and eviscerate is enough to make anyone wince. \u201cOpinion seems to be divided as to how much damage they do, but it certainly appears full on and very dangerous, especially the kicking to the gut,\u201d says Julian.  \nPhoto: Julian Robinson\nIf there were any doubt as to the damage these animals can do to one another, it's dispelled in the next shot, which shows one kangaroo appearing to kick at the scrotum of its enemy while standing on its tail. Julian explains:\n\u201cThese are big roos, standing over 7 feet (2 m) when on their toes trying to gain the height advantage. They attempt to rip the ears, eyes and nose of the opposition with the big sharp claws... More dramatically, they stand high on their tails while holding on to the opposition for support, then plunge their hind feet... into the belly of the victim, actually attempting \u2013 I think, watching as closely as I could \u2013 to do permanent damage to the reproductive organs.\u201d\nPhoto: Julian Robinson\nThe final shot seems to show an end to the struggle \u2013 Julian thought so \u2013 \u201cbut it turned out to be just a pause,\u201d and after one more photo he ran out of storage on his camera. \u201cBy the time I went back to the car to get a new card and encouraged my comrades to come and have a look, the roos took one look at us and hopped away, one behind the other. Whether there was an acknowledged winner and loser I will never know.\u201d\nToo late to capture the finale, but in the right place at the right time to catch the battle's beginnings and see most of the epic 10-minute encounter between a dominant male and a challenger with his own eyes. \u201cI don't know which was which [dominant male or challenger], but in the end one looked a bit more foolish than the other and casually sidled off a bit worse for wear, as in limping a bit,\u201d he concludes.\nPhoto: Julian Robinson\nAn ex-project manager/systems engineer in air traffic control systems and radar, Julian Robinson switched careers after developing Multiple Chemical Sensitivities which rendered him unable to inhabit hotels and office environments. However, he still keeps his eyes to the skies as a photographer of birds as well as other wildlife and panoramic landscapes \u2013 an occupation he embarked on after photographing a rare parrot that had 'invaded' the northern suburbs of Canberra in 2006.\nBorn in rural North Queensland and brought up in the Blue Mountains, Julian later lived in Sydney, then Melbourne, before moving to Canberra in 1984. He plans to travel more around Australia working on future photographic projects. We wish him luck.\nAdditional sources: 1, 2","author":"Karl Fabricius","web_category":"nature","title":"Boxing Kangaroos!","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/bigstockPeek-boo128179jpg_0","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/animals/news-boxing-kangaroos"}
