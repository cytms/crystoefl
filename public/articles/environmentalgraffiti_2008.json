But they not only awe us with their vastness, they also put on a spectacular lightshow in green, red or blue depending on the chemical reaction taking place.\nA so-called aurora \u201ccurtain\u201d, dwarfing a whole forest:Photo: \nImage: Image Editor\nWe\u2019ve brought you stunning images of the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis many times here on Environmental Graffiti, yet this phenomenon never ceases to amaze, especially if seen in perspective \u2013 hint: read through and you\u2019ll see what we mean! \nAlone with a \u201cquiet arc\u201d aurora:Photo: \nImage: Well Lucio\nWhat are aurorae and what causes them? The sun is the culprit, or better its winds carrying solar particles or photons that are funnelled down to the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere \u2013 that\u2019s 80 km or 50 miles above - and then accelerated along its magnetic field lines. Nitrogen atoms are ionized (or excited) through the collision with the solar wind particles and can either regain an electron, or oxygen and nitrogen atoms can return from their excited to a ground state. \nAdmiring the Northern Lights:Photo: \nImage: Nick Russill\nSounds like one hell of a cosmic stew of the Earth\u2019s electrons and protons with the atmosphere\u2019s atoms and molecules that\u2019s brewing in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere! No wonder the green aurorae seem to have escaped straight from a witch\u2019s cauldron.  \nWhat\u2019s brewing up north?Photo: \nImage: Xander\nActually, greenish-coloured aurorae are the result of oxygen emissions, as are the brownish-red hues. The colour just depends on the amount of energy absorbed.\nAll roads lead to the Aurora Borealis:Photo: \nImage: Omar Smith\nPuncturing clouds and dwarfing mountains:Photo: \nImage: Omar Smith\nBlue-coloured aurorae are the result of nitrogen emissions and the atoms regaining an electron after being ionized as described above. Aurorae are shaped by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and therefore can change constantly.\nEven taller trees merely serve as a backdrop to further illuminate the aurora:Photo: \nImage: Well Lucio\nRed aurorae are the result of nitrogen emissions as well, but after the atoms\u2019 return to their ground state from an excited, i.e. charged, state. \nA red Aurora Australis outlining a hill:Photo: \nImage: Fir0002\nDid you know that the aurora borealis is named after Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn, and Boreas, the Greek name for north wind? The Aurora Australis is not named for Australia but the Latin term for \u201cof the south\u201d, Australis.  \nThough aurorae can be spotted throughout the world and even on other planets, they are most visible closer to the poles because of the longer periods of darkness and the magnetic fields. And well, not everything is dwarfed by them.
