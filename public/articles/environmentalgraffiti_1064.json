That\u2019s according to an American citizen named Mr James. He reportedly told an undercover agent that he managed to smuggle highly endangered reptiles using a specially created compartment inside his prosthetic leg. He also told the agent that he sold three of the banded iguanas for $32,000 four years ago. Mr James could face up to five years in prison if convicted. \nProsecutors began an investigation into Mr James\u2019 affairs after the United States Fish and Wildlife services received a tip off, informing them that the Californian was in possession of the iguanas. Subsequently a full-scale, undercover operation was launched.\nWhen the suspect\u2019s house was searched in July, agents also found a further four banded iguanas. \nAccording to the BBC -\nThe Banded Iguana (Brachylophus fasciatus), is highly endangered and is therefore protected under an international treaty regulating trade in endangered species. The reptile is noted for its bright green skin.\nThe iguanas found in the apartment are due to be placed in a breeding programme in the US.\nVia BBC, Reuters\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Man uses fake leg to smuggle iguanas","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb18.webshots.com-45009-2177241390105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/man-uses-fake-leg-to-smuggle-iguanas/302"}
