Cleveland pitcher Bob Feller, then just 21 years old, threw it against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park on April 16, 1940.\nRed-Handed\nBoston Braves fans sat down to an unpleasant surprise on Opening Day in 1946.

The team agreed to pay their cleaning bills and made a public apology in a newspaper ad.\nMaking History\nJackie Robinson broke the color barrier on Opening Day in 1947, becoming the first African American to play for a Major League team.
