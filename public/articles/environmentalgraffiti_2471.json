This normally costs $200!\"  Image from joeycrabb\nIt seems that there's no limit to what people will submit themselves to if you try to pass it off as \"luxury\"-- a New York spa is offering the $216 \"geisha facial,\" an hour-long journey into a magical land where it's acceptable to smear feces on your face.\nThe salon, Shizuka, claims that geisha girls have been using bird poo to wash off their white makeup since the1700s, and that it has several redeeming qualities for your skin. This, and the two hundred dollar charge, come in spite of the fact that we've all been trained our entire lives to avoid contact with poo, and generally curse out loud when it strikes our automobiles.\nThe worst part of the story is that, like most things that are overpriced for no apparent reason, this will probably become phenomenally popular despite sounding like a bad bar bet at first: \"I can get rich white women to rub bird poo on their face.\" \"I can charge five dollars for a cup of coffee.\" \"I can put tap water in bottles and sell it.\" You get the idea.Environmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
