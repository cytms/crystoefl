But not everyone knows the founding father was also a volunteer firefighter who at age 30 established Philadelphia\u2019s first fire department. Tom Lingenfelter, president of the Heritage Collectors\u2019 Society in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, recently announced his discovery of a relic from this fascinating phase of Franklin\u2019s career: a document listing his name and those of the Union Fire Company\u2019s other members, thought to date to 1736.\nBorn in Boston in 1706, Franklin left home and moved to Philadelphia at age 17. His adoptive hometown still bears numerous traces of his extraordinary legacy, from the University of Pennsylvania to America\u2019s first lending library, the Library Company of Philadelphia. One of the city\u2019s most central and successful public figures from a very young age, Franklin cofounded the Union Fire Company, an all-volunteer brigade, in 1736.\n\u201cWhen Franklin starts the volunteer fire department in 1736, he\u2019s sort of an up-and-coming guy,\u201d said Libby O\u2019Connell, HISTORY\u2019s chief historian. \u201cHe\u2019s working his way up the rungs of civil and professional life. By founding the volunteer fire department in Philadelphia, he\u2019s setting himself up as a civic leader.\u201d He was likely inspired by America\u2019s first professional fire department, established in his native Boston in the 17th century, O\u2019Connell explained.\nActive until 1820, the Union Fire Company motivated other groups of people across Philadelphia to open their own volunteer brigades, O\u2019Connell said. These types of associations, formed by individuals who chose to help each other for the good of society, would eventually set the stage for professional organizations and raise standards of living across America. The same spirit can still be seen in volunteer fire departments today, she noted.\nLingenfelter came across the list of Union Fire Company members while sifting through his enormous collection of historical manuscripts. \u201cIt got my attention when I saw Ben Franklin\u2019s name on the list,\u201d Lingenfelter said. \u201cIt was in a pack of old business papers, and I don\u2019t remember where I got it.\u201d He said the papers seem to have belonged to Union Fire Company cofounder Joseph Paschall, a prominent merchant and member of Philadelphia\u2019s Common Council. Paschall, whose name appears first on the roster, served as the fire brigade\u2019s clerk.\nRoughly 10 inches long and 4 inches wide, the paper features the names of 26 men, scrawled in ink under the heading \u201cThe List of the Names of the Union Fire Company.\u201d Each name is marked with Xs in pencil and pen, an indication that the list might have functioned as an attendance sheet.\nBy comparing the collection of names to the Union Fire Company\u2019s book of minutes, Lingenfelter concluded that the document dates to 1736, the year of the department\u2019s founding. He said that the group\u2019s rules, also recorded in the minutes, offer a potential reason for the list\u2019s existence: Each member was required to keep two copies of the roster. This particular copy likely belonged to Paschall and appears to be in his handwriting, Lingenfelter said.\nIn addition to Franklin and Paschall, members listed in the document include William Rawle, a lawyer and abolitionist who served as U.S. district attorney for Pennsylvania after independence; Edward Roberts, a colonial mayor of Philadelphia; Richard Sewell, a merchant and sheriff; and Philip Syng, a renowned silversmith who made the inkstand used to sign the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.\nLingenfelter said he has no immediate plans for the document, which has yet to be analyzed and authenticated. And while it may not provide new information about the Union Fire Company, it serves as a reminder of Benjamin Franklin\u2019s numerous accomplishments and a fascinating project that typified his notion of civic responsibility. \u201cHis record on that type of public service was unbeatable,\u201d said O\u2019Connell.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Roster From Ben Franklin\u2019s Fire Department Found","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ben-franklin-firefighter.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/roster-from-ben-franklins-fire-department-found"}
