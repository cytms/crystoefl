Colby College, located in Waterville, Maine, (not too far from me here in Portland), didn't entirely cut its carbon dioxide emissions, but rather greatly reduced its emissions and bought offsets for the portion school officials were unable to eliminate.\n?\nIn 2002, each Colby student was responsible for around 15.6 tons of carbon dioxide. In 2012, the rate had been reduced to 5.72 tons per student and stands at 3.87 tons per student today. That's a remarkable reduction. The national average is around 9 tons per student.\n?\nColby had set a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2015 but hit the mark two years early, thanks in part to the installation of a large biomass heating plant that services campus buildings. School officials also installed a co-generation turbine that produces electricity using waste heat and hot water from campus, and the campus buys almost all of its electricity from renewable sources.\n?\nFor full details on how Colby achieved this admirable goal, click over and read the news release.\n?\nVia the Portland Press Herald\n?\nAre you on Twitter??Follow me (@sheagunther) there, I give good tweets.
