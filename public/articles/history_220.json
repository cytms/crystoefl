From harlots to murderers, any fugitive from justice wound up with his or her face or name on a poster offering a reward. Though many people associate them with the phrase \u201cdead or alive,\u201d these documents typically called for the taking of live outlaws so that they could stand trial. This is the case with the Frank and Jesse James poster, which outlines a $5,000 reward for \u201cthe arrest and delivery\u201d of each man, along with an additional $5,000 \u201cfor the conviction of either of the parties.\u201d\nThe poster references several crimes for which the James brothers were under indictment, including one of their most notorious episodes: the mistaken identity murder of John W. Sheets during the 1869 robbery of the Daviess County Savings Association in Gallatin, Missouri. According to multiple accounts, Jesse James shot Sheets after confusing him with Samuel Cox, a former Union colonel who had allegedly killed \u201cBloody\u201d Bill Anderson. Like the James brothers, Anderson had been a member of the Confederate guerrilla warfare group Quantrill\u2019s Raiders. Apparently, Jesse shot Sheets believing he was avenging Anderson\u2019s killing by Cox.\nEven for a murder, a $5,000 reward was large by 1881 standards, equivalent to over $113,000 in today\u2019s dollars. Other wanted posters of the time document sums of $50 to $500 for outlaws accused of the crime. Why such a big reward in this case? Simply put, Missouri\u2019s governor at the time, Thomas T. Crittendon, was frustrated. Over the preceding 12 years, the James gang had pulled off an average of one heist about every six months. At the time of the poster\u2019s issuance, Frank and Jesse were charged with two train robberies, one bank robbery and a murder in the last two years alone. Nevertheless, the pair remained at large. Crittendon wanted the brothers brought to justice, and the large reward provided great incentive to lawmen and citizens alike to deliver the James brothers to jail.\nA few months after Jesse\u2019s death, Frank James turned himself in to authorities for a murder committed during the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific train robbery referenced on the wanted poster. At the time, he said he had grown weary of living as a fugitive. After being acquitted of the murder in 1883, Frank led a quiet life for the next 30 years and worked various jobs, including as a shoe salesman and theater guard. He died of a heart attack on February 18, 1915.\nNo one ever collected the $5,000 reward offered by Governor Crittendon for the capture of the James brothers, but whoever wins the wanted poster at auction will take home a prize just as valuable: a rare piece of Old West history. While the seller requested anonymity, the poster possesses a verified chain of ownership or provenance: It was passed down through four generations of a St. Joseph, Missouri, family. According to Lebel, genuine wanted posters like this one are scarce not only because they were printed on cheap paper and designed to be thrown away whenever a fugitive was caught or died, but also because \u201cthere are so many fakes and reproductions. People have been printing phony wanted posters for years\u2014for fun, for Hollywood and to deceive\u2014so it\u2019s tricky to find authentic ones in the mix.\u201d \nInterestingly, Lebel\u2019s auction includes a second authentic wanted poster, this one for George Parker (alias Butch Cassidy) and Harry Longbaugh (alias the Sundance Kid). The 1904 placard, issued by the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, features photos of the duo along with a reward offer of $1,000 per man plus \u201c25 per cent, in proportionate shares, on all money recovered\u201d in relation to the pair\u2019s September 19, 1900, robbery of the First National Bank of Winnemucca, Nevada. The bandits scored $32,640, or roughly $882,000 in today\u2019s money, in the theft. Like the James brothers, Butch and Sundance got away with the crime.\nBrian Lebel\u2019s Old West Show and Auction is scheduled to take place from June 22 to June 24 in Denver.","author":"Elizabeth  Hanes","web_category":"news","title":"Jesse James Wanted Poster Goes Up for Auction","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesse-james-wanted-poster.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/jesse-james-wanted-poster-goes-up-for-auction"}
