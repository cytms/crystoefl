Carefully chosen and painstakingly positioned by Ju, potatoes, ginger root, tofu, cabbage, onions and cucumbers all come to life as actors instead of eats. The Last Supper gets a whole new meaning when the supper \u2013 and those eating it \u2013 are edible too. \nJu's first foray into vegetable art started with the creation of a fabulous ensemble made of several kilograms of peas in 2006. Over the next two years, she frequently scoured local markets in search of subjects to play starring roles in her  Vegetable Museum, a collection of photographs based on world-renowned paintings. For instance, in her re-staging of La Libert? Guidant le Peuple, which she named La Libert? Guidant les L?gumes (Liberty Leading the Vegetables), she calls upon a large cast to re-enact the epic scene: \nTake a look, and see how many vegetables, and how many paintings you can recognize.\n1.
