Still, if this is your perception, just be thankful we humans don\u2019t have to literally lug the load of our kids around too often. Even if a pushchair or pram is unavailable for whatever reason, let\u2019s face it, at least there aren\u2019t hundreds of the little brats to haul about the place. Pity old mother wolf spider can\u2019t say the same.\nAll aboard, the spider bus is departing!Photo: Photo: teejaybee\nPhoto: Photo: teejaybee\nWolf spiders are unique among their kind owing to their method of infant care. Immediately after the young spiderlings have hatched, they climb up their mother's legs and crowd onto her back in a wriggling mass of juvenile spiderishness. The young spiders ride around in this group piggyback fashion for roughly a week until partially grown and all set to disperse into the big wide world, either by ballooning through the air on silk strands or simply by scurrying off along the ground.\nGot a monkey on your back? Funny looking monkeysPhoto: Photo: teejaybee\nFemales of many spider species care for their young in some way, shape or form \u2013 for example, by sharing food with them \u2013 but rarely is such a high degree of parental protection displayed as it is by the wolf spider. Even while carrying around this squirming spider nursery on her abdomen, this most motherly of arachnids still finds time to continue hunting down small insects on which to feed. Puts even the busiest of working moms to shame.\nYeehaw, ride em offspring!Photo: Photo: Clinton & Charles Robertson\nPhoto: Photo: Photographer unknown\nBefore this army of tiny spiders are ready to emerge and cling to the bristles on their mother's back, they're kept snug in the safe confines of a protective silken case. The female Wolf spider builds a ball-shaped egg sac of white papery silk, which she carries along attached via strong silk to the spinnerets at the end of her abdomen. Hauling this brood to be is again unique among spiders, and because the wolf spider's jaws are not tied up, she is free to continue hunting. \nYummy mummy: Wolf spider carrying her egg sacPhoto: Photo: Ian W Fieggen\nIt makes you realise how tenderly maternal even arthropods can be. Yet while the wolf spider may well win Mum of the Year among her fellow creepy crawlies, the person in this last clip must really have a strong stomach for all things spidery.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
