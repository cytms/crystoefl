At a recent demonstration, Biryukov poured a small amount of a dustlike powder onto an electrified solar cell. The dust was immediately thrown back prevented by the electric field from settling onto the panel. [Video: A Dust-Repelling Solar Panel]\n?\nTwo electrodes are used to repel the dust. One electrode charges the particles through a process called field charging, or ion bombardment. This gives all particles, regardless of size, the same charge, Biryukov told ?TechNewsDaily. Another electrode bearing the opposite charge then repels the particles.\n?\nThis technology can be added to solar panels after they have already been manufactured and installed, meaning it can be used to retrofit old solar cells, Biryukov said.\n?\nWhile it's better at repelling dust, it can also be used to clean solar panels, said David Faiman, also a researcher at Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center who is familiar with Biryukov's research but not directly involved. Since weather conditions such as humidity affect how strongly dust adheres to the panels, Biryukov has made a special computerized control system designed to pick the right moment for cleaning, he said.\n?\nThe process can also sort particles of specific sizes, which could make it useful in the production of powdered foods and pharmaceuticals, which depend upon specific particle sizes to function optimally, Biryukov added.\n?\n?\nThis story was generated during a trip paid for by American Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. \n?\nEmail Douglas Main or follow him @Douglas_Main.
