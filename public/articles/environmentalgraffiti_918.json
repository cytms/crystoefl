The council\u2019s executive member for the environment, Jason Fazackarley, said: \"I am not a killjoy. Balloons may look nice but once they are released into the atmosphere, whoosh, they are gone. Then they might choke some innocent turtle to death. They think it is a jellyfish and eat it and die horribly and slowly.\"\nHe was quick to point out that not all balloons were banned. The ban applies to balloon releases on land. Mostly this applies to events like business openings or charity fundraisers.\nAt least one charity was upset by the ban. Helen Somerset-How of the Rainbow Centre near Portsmoth described how the group raised more than ¢G1000 for charity last year by selling balloons that were later released in a race. She said: \"We sold each balloon for five pounds which raised funds for us. What else are we supposed to do - cut a ribbon? That's nothing compared to the fun and visual impact of a balloon race.\"\nBalloons have been found to kill some marine animals, generally ones who mistake the latex for jellyfish or another form of food. The latex of a balloon can block breathing passages or block the animals\u2019 digestive systems, causing a painful death. Some small animals can also get tangled in the balloons\u2019 ribbons and die. \nInfo from Telegraph\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers choice awards.
