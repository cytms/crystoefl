A Sense of Faith\nPhoto: Image from Flickr\nLoma Linda, California, boasts the highest concentration of Seventh-Day Adventists in the world, and the average Adventist man lives 11 years longer than the average American man.  This is also a factor in Sardinia,  where a large Catholic population fuels one of the \"Blue Zones\" and lives far longer than the average Italian.\n4.  A Sense of Purpose\nJapan possesses an overwhelming sense of purpose,  Buettner reports, and the concept has a name: ikigai.  Loosely translated, it means \"that which makes one's life most worth living.\"  It strikes him then, as no coincidence that Okinawa has the longest disease-free life expectancies in the world.\nPhoto: Image from Flickr\n3.  Low-Intensity Activity\nLow-intensity activity does a phenomenal job of keeping the body in working order without placing too much stress on an aging system: getting out an walking, or enjoying some form or recreation also contributes to a sense of independence that allows the mindset needed for the other points to flourish.\nPhoto: Image from Flickr\n2.  An Investment in Family\nFamily, like the previous item, helps develop support structures, as well as an essential mindset of caring; Buettner simply states that he's never met a mean centenarian.\nPhoto: Image from Flickr\n1.  A Plant-based Diet\nFinally, yes, there is one essential oddity-- a diet that's drastically different from that of most Americans.\nConsistently, Buettner reports people eating small portions and not much meat in their diets. This accounts for the widespread success outside of the United States, especially in places like Italy, Japan, and Costa Rica, where culture has embraced a different style of cooking.\nPhoto: Image from Flickr\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
