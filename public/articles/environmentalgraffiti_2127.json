For comparison, the lowest sound the human ear can detect is 10,000 milihertz, meaning we will never hear the hum of the Earth, or the sounds that are likely made by Venus and Mars in similar fashions.  While our sister planet, and the red war god waltzing about the sky both fail to feature oceans, they are geologically unstable enough to produce a similar effect, geologists believe.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
