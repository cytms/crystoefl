Hawaii, right? Actually, Alaska, which has 47,000 miles of ocean shoreline with loads of surfing potential, as the locals know. Not to mention some of the most awesome scenery you can imagine. \u201cThis is the Final Frontier, there\u2019s no doubt \u2018bout it,\u201d says Michael Vertido on WannaSurf.com. A surfing expedition to the Land of the Midnight Sun would unquestionably be the experience of a lifetime, and should not be missed. Here are some of the, er, coolest hotspots. \nGetting from place to place in Alaska can be difficult and requires patience. Jake Howard, in a Surfer magazine article entitled \u201cAlaskan Edge\u201d, explains, \u201cYou must be willing to brave alternative methods of transport.\u201d These include bush planes, skiffs, sturdy fishing boats and ferries. Roads are tricky to find; the Alaskan Highway runs mostly up the eastern edge of the state. \nSome of the best-charted surf areas of Alaska include the Aleutian Islands, Kodiak Island, Sitka Sound and Yakutat. \u201cThe Aleutians are the frozen Hawaii,\u201d reckons Vertido. And the best time for good weather and big swells is summer to early fall. Alaska is, of course, frigid in winter. Blinding blizzards can hit suddenly, and just as Hawaii has the trade winds, the Aleutians have the Williwaws, sideways-blowing winds with speeds of up to 100mph. \nPhoto: Doug Helton, NOAA Photo Library\nCity Beach, on Adak Island, about halfway between Alaska and Russia, has frequent, small but good quality waves for all-level surfers. Further north are The Lagoons and Loran Point, access to which requires driving an off-road vehicle to the bay, and then a long paddle. Still, it\u2019s worth the work, as Loran Point has world-class waves likened to those of Waimea Bay in Hawaii \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise to learn it\u2019s for experienced surfers only. The powerful waves, breaking over the boulder-strewn bottom, range in length from 300 to 500 meters (985 to 1,640 ft) or greater, while the swell starts to work at a height of 3 meters (10 ft).\nRainbow Point, near the port of Dutch Harbor, features world-class waves for all-level surfers, although it's only accessible by plane. Definitely get to know the locals here as apparently the fishermen know everything. The waves, meanwhile, are hollow, fast and powerful. On average, the wavelength ranges from 50 to 150 meters (164 to 492 ft), but can be greater than 500 meters (1,640 ft). Swells range from 1 meter to 4 meter (3 to 12 ft) in height, and low and mid tide are said to be the best times to catch waves. Beneath the surface of the water is an artificial reef; just watch out for the sea urchins.\nOn Kodiak Island, Fossil Beach offers \u201cregional classic quality\u201d waves for all-level surfers. Swells can range from 1 meter (3 ft) to 5 meters (16 ft) and more. The pristine beach is black sand, with pink sand running up-river. Mill Bay, on the northern side of Kodiak town, features clean, barreling waves in winter.\nPhoto: Frank Kovalchek, Alaskan Dude\nKnown as Surf City Alaska, Yakutat has decent waves for all surfers and you can camp there too. The beaches in Yakutat are tribal, so people from out of town are advised not to leave a mess. Shoals Reef, a.k.a. The Wall, in the Sitka Sound, has \u201cregional classic\u201d breaks for experienced surfers over reef and sharp rocks, best caught at low tide only. Roaming these parts are orcas, stellar sea lions, grizzlies and wolves \u2013 so the dangers don\u2019t simply come from the elements!\nNeedless to say, if you're happy to brave chilly temperatures, it's certainly worth visiting Alaska to ride the waves and see the breathtaking sights.","author":"carladerrico","web_category":"outdoor","title":"The Coolest Surf Spots in Alaska","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/0x550.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-cool-surfing-hot-spots-alaska"}
