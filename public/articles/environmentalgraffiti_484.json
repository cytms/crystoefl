Woman jumps to her death after being bitten by a tick (April 2008) Photo:   Jan Linton, 56 was bitten by a tick when staying and working on a friend\u2019s 9 acre property in France. Within 6 months she was acting very strangely and had her friends and family worried for her safety. In fact she had caught Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness that can cause psychotic episodes and delusional behavior. One of the first stages of Lyme disease includes a \u2018bulls-eye\u2019 rash and aching joints. If caught at this stage, it can be treated with antibiotics.

Young girl killed by mosquito bites (May 2002) Photo:   Maria McGranaghan, 13, died from a heart attack while holidaying in Corfu. It was diagnosed that she had been bitten all over by mosquitoes after sleeping outside. The medical team thought that the bites had become inflamed, which could have caused the heart attack.  In addition to this, malaria, which is a mosquito borne disease, kills millions of people every year. For example around 1,000,000 people will die every year in Africa. It is one of the planet's deadliest diseases.  According to Dr Wilson of Harvard University there are 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10 quintillion) insects in the world! That equates to almost 1.5 billion insects per person. It may be far fetched and reminiscent of a Stephen King novel, but there is no doubting that insects may indeed get \u2018their own back\u2019 after so many years of ridicule and hate.
