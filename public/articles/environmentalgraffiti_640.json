Comparisons with the Moon are not so farfetched as the ancient plateau is almost as old as the stars \u2013 at 1.8 billion years (yes, that\u2019s with a 'b'!), it houses some of the oldest rock formations on Earth. \nSmooth and silent witnesses of time:Photo: \nImage: Vitorio Benedetti\nChapada dos Veadeiros, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001, is famous for its breathtaking landscape, flora and fauna, so much so that the strange beauty of Vale da Lua is often just mentioned as an aside. But the peculiar, moon-like valley is worth a visit just by itself and its visitors are awed by the smooth, grey rocks that have been washed out by the crystal clear waters of the San Miguel River over the ages. \nThese are clearly moon rocks, or are they?Photo: \nImage: Vitorio Benedetti\nThe friction of sand carried in the water has dug small craters into the rocks, especially where the rapids are strongest. Vale da Lua is a work in progress and will change further due to the constant shaping of the water. The heavy and sudden downpours during the rainy season make sure that the river never runs dry and that visitors stay at bay.   \nThe steady stream that carves the stone:Photo: \nImage: Nilton Aguillar deCosta\nThe Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park in the state of Goias, a few kilometers from the town of Sao Jorge, today occupies an area of 65,515 ha (655 sq km) \u2013 only about one tenth of what it was when created as National Park Tocantins with an area of 650,000 ha on January 11, 1961 by then-President Juscelino Kubitscheck.  \nClimbing among ancient rocks:Photo: \nImage: Ana Cotta\nThe high-altitude Cerrado or open pasture sports elevations of between 600 and 1650 meters and is Central Brazil\u2019s highest plain. The park\u2019s highest point is Serra da Santana at 1691 meters above sea level. As one of Brazil\u2019s areas of greatest biodiversity, the rich fauna includes many endangered species like the pampas deer, the maned wolf, the ema, anteater, giant armadillo and many others. Many of the local plant varieties \u2013 25 types of orchids, for example \u2013 are unique to the area.  \nThe national park as captured via SPOT satellite:Photo: \nImage: Cnes\nThe park\u2019s mineral rich rocks - quartz with various crystals \u2013 were long exploited by miners but, realising the area\u2019s potential as a nature sanctuary, 3% of the park\u2019s area is today used for tourism, the rest for research and preservation. Many therapists and nature lovers swear by the energy and healing power of the area\u2019s rock crystals.   \nLooks like moon rocks:Photo: \nImage: Leonardo C.
