Framed against the sky in a field in Napa, California, a filing cabinet \u2013 curiously filled with the dismantled auto parts of a 1974 sports car \u2013 towers some 65 feet into the air, a monolith of our own making.\nPhoto: Photo: Samuel Yates\nA white collar worker\u2019s wet dream \u2013 or worst nightmare \u2013 this most phallic of office cabinets is officially the world\u2019s tallest, down in the Guinness Book of Records as \u2018The Tallest File Cabinet on Earth\u2019. In actual fact, though, this is not one filing cabinet, but a total of some 60 individual drawers stacked and welded together \u2013 and all in the name of art.\nPhoto: Photo: curiousyellow\nThis seven-storey outdoor sculpture is the work of artist Samuel Yates. It was built in 2000 from filing cabinets engineered and weatherproofed to withstand wind, rain, and even earthquakes. Considerable work went into its construction, with a hole bored into the ground by great drill to lay the foundations and a crane used to erect the final structure.  \nPhoto: Photo: hyperborea\nEnigmatically titled UNTITLED (Minuet in MG), the MG is a reference to the automobile that lies within \u2013 the 74 MG Midget which, says Yates\u2019 website, \u201cwas donated, shredded, steamrolled, photographed, bagged, labeled, numbered, and filed by weight from heaviest to lightest in milligrams (mgs) \u2013 an MG in mgs.\u201d Just hide your eyes if you\u2019re a classic car collector.\nPhoto: Photo: heather\nThat said, Yates\u2019 website continues : \u201cThe DMV registration for the shredded car filed inside the cabinet officially indicates possession by its owner.\u201d It\u2019s OK, Sam, we trust you. We\u2019re just not so sure we trust that your mini-auto parts store-cum-skyscraper will sway but not fall over in a quake that registers high on the Richter scale. \nFor more of the artist's work, visit his website.
