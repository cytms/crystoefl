Recently, a senior wildlife official was arrested amid claims that he organized the killings of severely endangered mountain gorillas.\nHonore Mashagiro is a member of the Congolese Nature Conservation Institute (ICCN), the group that recently brought charges against him for the killings.\nThey argue that he is responsible for the killings of some or all of the 10 gorillas killed last year in Virunga National Park. The park is a UNESCO world heritage site but has been taken over by rebel groups in the country\u2019s lawless eastern region.\nThe park is a hotbed of conflict in the war torn country, as well as the home of more than half the world\u2019s 700 or so remaining mountain gorillas.\nEnvironmental groups believe Mashagiro masterminded the killings of the gorillas and instructed as many as six other men to participate. They say the killings were linked to the charcoal industry.\nThe gorillas were not killed for trophies or meat because they were merely shot and left undisturbed, suggesting that someone just wanted them out of the way so they could use the forest. The environmental groups believe they were killed as a distraction, to help divert attention and resources away from the illegal trade in charcoal in the park.\nAmir Bazarbacha of the group WildlifeDirect said:\n\n\nInfo from BBC\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers' choice awards.
