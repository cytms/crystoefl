Sounds bizarre? Well, that\u2019s probably because it is.\nMusician Terje Isungset has been carving his chilly instruments from ice for the past 20 years. Many moons ago, the budding percussionist, not content with experimenting on stone and glass, decided to use what was available around him, and being Norwegian that happened to be ice. But not just any old ice, Insungset chips away at a 2,500-year-old glacier:\nThe premise for the drastic change in instrument came after being disillusioned with life as a drummer.\nTo do this, Isungset decided the only way he could escape normal music traditions was to change the instruments, as well as the way he approached the music. Now, Isungest\u2019s musical talents are in high demand. He has recorded five \u2018ice\u2019 albums and often plays to international audiences.\nPhoto: Icicle Bells\nHis latest show, Cinderella is currently showing at Lyric Hammersmith in London. For this he created an ice trumpet, which he plays along with a glass drum kit, bicycle wheel and his faithful mouth organ made of metal from a WWII German bomber.\nCinderella is playing until January 3, 2009.\nSource 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
