The brilliant metallic colouring shouldn\u2019t deflect from what a highly specialised parasitic critter this is. In point of fact, the cuckoo wasp has a distinctly subtle way of avoiding detection, which owes less to the way it looks than the way it smells.\nSmash and grab: beewolf dragging a bee to its burrowPhoto: Image: Camerar\nThe female cuckoo wasp lays her eggs in honeybees paralysed by the European beewolf. What makes her special, however, is that she does so right under the beewolf\u2019s nose \u2013 entering its nest burrow as it comes and goes, oblivious. The cuckoo wasp\u2019s larva is then later able to climb onto, kill, and feed on the beewolf larva, as well as the other bees. How does the cuckoo wasp get away with such a murderous sleight of antenna? It\u2019s all about chemistry.\nOn the defensive: cuckoo wasp, hard cuticle on displayPhoto: Image: Pudding4brains \nTo us, the cuckoo wasp might appear an innocuous, even pretty looking bug, but the beewolf wasn\u2019t born yesterday and doesn\u2019t see its brightly coloured butt in the same light. If the cuckoo wasp is visually identified by the beewolf skulking in front of its nest mound, it\u2019s unceremoniously attacked and driven off. The cuckoo wasp has a thick cuticle shell and can roll up into a protective ball, but the beewolf is much bigger, with a mean sting in its tail and strong biting mandibles.\nCuckoo in wolf\u2019s clothing: sweet and innocent looking cuckoo waspPhoto: Image: -AVG-\nSo the cuckoo wasp keeps a low profile, waiting for an opportunity to sneak into the host\u2019s nest; she doesn\u2019t need a second invitation, though, and once inside she comes into her own. The beewolf seems unable to detect the cuckoo wasp down in the dark burrow, passing her by even as close as 2 cm away. More importantly, the cuckoo wasp leaves no scent trace of her treacherous visit behind, which might cause the beewolf to get rid of the potentially infested bees.\nChemical cloaking: incandescent colour, undetectable scentPhoto: Image: -AVG-\nIt\u2019s as if the cuckoo wasp is invisible, and effectively she is. The Frontiers in Zoology study, \u2018Cuckoo in Wolf\u2019s Clothing?\u2019 concluded that the female cuckoo wasp closely mimics the chemical composition \u2013 read: smell \u2013 of the female beewolf\u2019s cuticle shell. Through chemical mimicry that has evolved through specific focus on one host, the cuckoo wasp has synthesised a chemical cloak that conceals all signs of her presence on the beewolf\u2019s turf. \nDinner is served: beewolf with honeybee prey in towPhoto: Image: Alvesgaspar\nApparently this is the first reported evidence for chemical mimicry of a solitary wasp like the beewolf. Of course the beewolf is no angel; it can paralyse a lovable honeybee as easily as taking pollen from a flower. Like the cuckoo wasp, the beewolf itself feeds on nectar, but the female will go hunting for up to six bees, which she stings and drags back to her burrow as food for her offspring. Unless, as we know, the cuckoo wasp gets in there first.\nBigger picture: no hiding place for the beewolfPhoto: Image: Camerar\nThe problem is that the beewolf\u2019s bee-stocked nests are so threatened by the cuckoo wasp that the situation is seriously impacting on its evolutionary fitness. With a rate of up to 30% parasitism, the cuckoo wasp may well be steadily driving the beewolf to extinction. Scientists compare the struggle between the species to an \u201cevolutionary arms race\u201d. If so, the cuckoo wasp is like a super-power with spy planes and the latest cloaking devices. It's just not fair to others with less sophisticated arsenals.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
