And local authorities are not too upset either as Buff Diss has long since exchanged his spray paints for simple masking tape. \n\u201cAftermatch\u201d:Photo: \nBuff Diss says about the work above: \u201cWhen I did that piece with the match I liked the idea of the aftermath. How did it start and was it a match? That piece was so enjoyable to do. And I felt so lucky to be able to find that space and to be able to create something in a space like that.\u201d \n\u201cTrain train\u201d \u2013 even the Germans didn\u2019t know what to make of it:Photo: \nOn a recent trip to Berlin, he even got the chance to use his graffiti art on an InterRegio prototype, one of Germany\u2019s new regional trains. Asked about reactions by officials, Buff Diss replies: \u201cBecause it comes off, a majority of authorities doesn\u2019t know what to do. When I see that it comes off and it doesn\u2019t affect the architecture, I enjoy the confusion it creates.\u201d  \n\u201cSistine Hotel\u201d:Photo: \nIn a local Walrus TV Artist Feature, Buff Diss talks about his motivation and constant interaction with the urban environment and the city\u2019s architecture. \n\u201cDaedelus\u201d:Photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/buffdiss/3524594371\nMore permanent than chalk yet less environmentally damaging than spray paints, could  masking tape be the new graffiti medium? Says Buff Diss:   \nFound in the trees \u2013 \u201cWinter Burn\u201d:Photo: \nFor Buff Diss, it\u2019s all about the vibe, the relationship graffiti artists have with the environment they\u2019re in. Like urban explorers, they discover a city\u2019s underbelly and go where most citizens would not. He explains:\nUnder the skin of the city \u2013 \u201cTax Deductable Darls\u201d:Photo: \n\u201cI think graffiti artists are really blessed in that context; they get to see under the skin of the city. All the skeletons that sit in the city that [have] got so many stories - and that\u2019s what\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\n\u201cRebeldia\u201d:Photo: \nAt the recent GAS exhibition:Photo: \nFrom the WOW exhibition at GPO:Photo: \nWould Buff Diss ever want to do anything else? Not likely, he says: \u201cI could spend the rest of my life finding derelict warehouses and just playing in the room, and just leaving art in the room play. Interpret it in the different spaces, just having conversations with old buildings perhaps.\u201d We sure hope he\u2019ll do this a bit longer to put into context for us what would be hidden otherwise.                 \n\u201cIn Company with Giants\u201d:Photo: \nHere\u2019s a video of the artist creating one of his tape art works from start to finish, with just the right kind of background music:\nYou can view many more of Buff Diss\u2019s masking tape artworks on his Flickr page.
