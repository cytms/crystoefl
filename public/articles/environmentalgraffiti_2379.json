Photo: dorne Most public pools don\u2019t use environmentally sound disinfectant agents in the water; they use brominating agents.

You\u2019re public pool could seriously infect you or kill you. Long-term exposure (frequent visits every week) to pool water with these toxic mixtures have been proven to cause gene mutations, induce birth defects, increase the aging process, cause respiratory ailments and possibly induce cancer.
