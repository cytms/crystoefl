If you feel like writing for us, drop us an email!\nImagine powering your electricity by sitting down. Two MIT students have found a way to be lazy and generate their electricity by doing exactly this.\nJames Graham and Thaddeus Jusczyk have showed that the simple act of sitting on a stool can generate enough power to turn on 4 LED lights and that a single stride provides enough power to light a single 60 Watt light bulb for 1 second.\nA relatively few 84 million strides could power a space shuttle launch.\nThe Crowd Farm concept relies on the related principle that mechanical movement can be converted into electricity, though on a larger scale. The mechanics would be supplied by a spongy floor in which embedded blocks move under the weight of passing pedestrians. The conversion process itself could be handled by a generator that uses a rotating coil and electromagnets to produce an electric current from the mechanical movement.\nThis all leads you to ask yourself, very seriously, \u201cHow much power do I generate by sitting on the toilet?\u201d","author":"Simmons","web_category":"environmentgreen-tech","title":"How Much Power Do I Generate by Sitting on the Toilet?","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/images/http-msnbcmedia.msn.com-j-msnbc-Components-Photos-070806-070806-crowdfarm-hlg-12p.hlarge.img_assist_custom-600x264.jpg","url":"http://www.techgraffiti.com/news-how-much-power-do-i-generate-sitting-toilet"}
