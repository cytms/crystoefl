Via\nImagine a common scenario: you\u2019ve been driving for hours, you\u2019re hot, partially sweaty and full to the brim, you\u2019ve recently missed that \u2018turn here\u2019 sign and that next sign ain\u2019t appearing on the horizon line any time soon, so you stop the car, do your business and then drive on, right?\nWrong this is a story of a man whose penis was bitten by a snake.\n\nThe man who has been unnamed for obvious reasons, was a tourist driving through a road in Queensland, on nearing the Town of Laura he realized he couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer and decided to make a toilet stop. At the side of the road he undid his pants and crouched down. ?Only moments later, a venomous brown snake had slithered through his legs and bitten his \u201cPrince Albert.\u201d\nThe tourist miraculously survived, as an ambulance spokesman elegantly explained \u2018It certainly had a swipe at him, but it didn't envenomate him.\u2019 He was treated at the scene by having his penis wrapped in plastic. It was later confirmed that no poison had spread.\nHe did however receive a savage gouging to his gonads and tip, and a heavy combo of multiple vomiting and stomach pains. After recovering at the hospital he quotes with hindsight \u201cI\u2019m a bit shocked and embarrassed but I\u2019m lucky.\u2019\n(Obviously he was referring to his life, not his manhood).\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
