The conservancy wants the day pictured as a snapshot of a larger problem, with some 182 pounds of trash being collected every mile of shoreline policed. The charity believes this exposes an attitude of carelessness.:\"Trash doesn't fall from the sky, it falls from our hands\", said Vikki Spriulli, OC President, in an interview.\nOverall, 57 percent of the trash was related to recreational activities, and another 33 percent to smoking. Obviously, this is not an issue that is caused primarily by large corporations, but instead, generated by consumers who can't be bothered to pick up after themselves.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
