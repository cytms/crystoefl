I am not making this up.\nImage from dsgnctrl on Flickr\n\nThe project, which is attempting to learn more about flight characteristics in support of building spacecraft in the future, has already proven some of its early ambition\n-- the prototype planes have been through wind tunnel tests up to Mach 7, and 200 degrees Celsius.  \nObviously, this is no ordinary paper-- it's been heat-treated-- but Japanese officials believe that the conditions they've produced will approximate what the planes might face during re-entry to the earth's atmosphere.  The single biggest challenge to the project so far?  finding the things after they land-- officials are skeptical about attaching a transmitter because of how they might damage the flight characteristics.\nSources: Yahoo, Physorg\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
