Image from romsrini on Flickr\n\nThe sex life of the octopus has always been a little bit of a mystery to scientists-- let's face it, there's an even chance that their own sex life is a mystery to you if you study octopus sex-- largely because the ones in captivity are so loathe to bump uglies.  It's because of this knowledge gap that a team from UC Berkeley traveled to Indonesia to play voyeur, and were treated to a behavioral jackpot.\nThe male animals were jealously guarding their mates at almost all times, and when they perceived a challenge for her affection, they would simply strangle the other suitor to death with their tentacles.  Perhaps more shocking, though, was the evidence of drag queens in the octopus community; smaller males, who would perhaps not be able to find a mate in open competition, disguised themselves as females by changing the colors of their skin, achieving a level of comfort before revealing themselves to be male.\nThe team points out that these are not a unique species of octopus, and therefore it can be conjectured that others behave in the same fashion.  I have to wonder if the scientists didn't stumble into some sort of octopus version of bacchanalia.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
