As you look up, you\u2019re face to belly with a commercial airliner. After a few seconds, it\u2019s all over. Fiction? We\u2019ve found a few places where it\u2019s not. Before you scream \u2018shopped\u2019, wait for the videos\u2026\nIn case of a beach landing, use your blanket as a beach towel:Photo: \nImage: Todd Neville\nThe beach in these first two images is famous Maho Beach, adjacent to Princess Juliana International Airport on Saint Martin or St. Maarten, the eastern Caribbean island\u2019s Dutch part. Planes fly by so close that sun bathers seem to be able to reach out their hand and touch them \u2013 Maho Beach therefore attracts scores of plane spotters every day. Says Drew about the experience:\nA current sign reads: \u201cJet blast of departing and arriving aircraft can cause severe physical harm resulting in extreme bodily harm and/or death.\u201d Er, thanks for the warning.\nPhoto: \nImage: Jj04\nIf you say so, Christine. We\u2019re still skeptical about the entertainment value and want to see for ourselves \u2013 here\u2019s a video of various landings (turn down the volume!):\nAfter Hurricane Omar hit on October 16, 2008, many local businesses were destroyed but most beach shacks and restaurants popular with plane spotters have reopened since. The beach, however, was reduced to boulders but is still popular with windsurfers and skimboarders because of the semi-large waves caused by the jet blasts of planes taking off. It is so strong, in fact, that people standing on the beach can get blown into the water.\nMoving elsewhere, here\u2019s a video of people who do close encounters of the plane kind for entertainment: The pilot of a small plane is trying to land on top of a moving RV, world\u2019s shortest runway, at 60 miles an hour! After the successful landing, one wonders how the plane will get down again.\nAnd here\u2019s an image is of Iberia Airbus A-340 on October 10th, 2007 when it almost caused a major accident as it was landing at Quito International Airport in Ecuador. Whoever lives in that house surely must\u2019ve gotten the shock of their lives!\nPhoto: \nImage: Alejandro Cadena\nCasual shoppers in Hong Kong\u2019s Kowloon City don\u2019t even seem to notice as planes approach Kai Tak Airport, apparently touching department stores, churches and residential houses on their path. Guess you can get used to anything, right?\nMany mishaps have taken place during airshows, little wonder when even the regular maneuvers just seem to leave a hair\u2019s width between planes:\nHere at a Canadian airshow:\nImage: Brian Wright\nA nice place to live \u2013 right under the approach of Brussels\u2019 airport Zaventem. The two guys in the video seem to be a bit shocked about the noise that has brought their house down\u2026\nHey, don\u2019t bomb my house:Photo: \nImage: Mike Renlund\nThe people in the houses above in Salt Lake City, Utah might be getting more than they bargained for. The red stuff is fire retardant being dropped to prevent canyon fires. However, you don\u2019t want to get caught in the middle.\nPlane spotters might get their money\u2019s worth but we\u2019re not sure how beneficial close encounters of the plane kind may be other than making for some spectacular images.\nSources: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
