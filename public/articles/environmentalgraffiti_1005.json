The island was the last private island in New York City, and the buying price was $2 million.\nThe island was not attractive to real estate developers, as it is only accessible by boat. Although it could have become an industrial area, or even a prison like nearby Riker\u2019s Island, the Trust for Public Land brought the high bid.  The island will be preserved as a refuge for the island\u2019s birds and wildlife.\nThe island\u2019s previous owners, sand and gravel company Hampton Scrows, bought the island for $10 in the 1970s. It was previously owned by a beer magnate and former Yankees owner Col. Jacob Ruppert. The island will be preserved, and the only possible future human presence will be eco-tourism.\nSource: Reuters\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"NYC Island is For the Birds","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/thumbW4PpoO.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/businesspolitics/nyc-island-is-for-the-birds/555"}
