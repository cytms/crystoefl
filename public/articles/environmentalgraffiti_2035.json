Monsoon tourists describe it as a wall of rain or a sheet of rain \u2013 think of a giant tap suddenly being turned on to drench parts of the world. And mull over the fact that one good monsoon day in Mumbai, for example, can mean dousing the city in 800 mm of rain \u2013 Munich\u2019s annual rainfall! Here\u2019s the spectacle in pictures.  \nA rain-swept road in Bangalore:Photo: \nImage via paintedstork\nThe Asian Monsoon is the best known among the world\u2019s monsoons because it dwarfs the North American and African Monsoon in terms of intensity and the number of people affected by it. \nEncyclopaedia Britannica defines the monsoon as \u201ca major wind system that seasonally reverses its direction\u201d caused by \u201cdifferent warming trends over land and sea.\u201d In other words, the huge land mass that makes up South Asia (India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) starts heating up around the beginning of April and reaches temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and over. The surrounding water bodies, namely the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, stay much cooler at around 25 degrees (77 degrees F) maximum, causing a temperature difference between land and sea of up to 20 (36) degrees! \nMonsoon clouds over the Vindhya mountain range in west-central India:Photo: \nImage: Gerald Anfossi \nAs the pre-monsoon heat builds up over the land mass, less dense air rises up, thereby forming areas of low pressure, especially over North India and the Himalayas. At the same time, the air over the ocean is cooler, and denser air remains at the surface, thereby forming high-pressure areas.     \nSimilar to a pressure cooker, this pent-up pressure has to be released, which is why air starts moving from the oceans to the land masses, bringing with it moisture-rich southwest winds that fork at the tip of the subcontinent \u2013 one arm moving up from Sri Lanka along the Arabian Sea, the other moving up along the Bay of Bengal into northeastern India and Bangladesh.\nA diagram of the monsoon moving up India's eastern and western coastline:Photo: \nImage via National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nInterestingly but comprehensibly, this energy imbalance can be felt by humans and animals alike during the monsoon built-up. Many people, apart from feeling hot, report feeling restless, uneasy yet also excited before the onset of the monsoon as if waiting to be charged with new energy themselves.      \nSo it is that the onset of the monsoon is celebrated anew every year, and serious rain dances before and raucous dances during the first rains can be witnessed throughout South Asia.  \nDressed for the occasion - Indian children playing in the rain:Photo: \nImage: Vijay Shah\nLife goes on - shoppers on Linking Road in Mumbai:Photo: \nImage via student-direct  \nThough dancing in the rain is surely innocent fun, walking through waterlogged areas is not. Poisonous snakes, invisible holes ready to suck in the unsuspecting and water-borne diseases wreak havoc each monsoon season.  \nTo be avoided - walking on waterlogged roads, here in Kolkata:Photo: \nImage via indiamike \nKnowing the exact onset of the monsoon is important for South Asia\u2019s farmers as they need to time the sowing of crop accordingly. No wonder that come late May/early June, the respective meteorological institutes in each country are bugged for predictions on a daily basis. \nThis year, no low-pressure area developed over the Bay of Bengal to pull the monsoon northward, causing rainfall 45% less than normal in June. This is cause for concern because reservoirs and lakes are near empty, already causing water cuts in many areas. Plus, agriculture provides a livelihood for many; almost 60% of India\u2019s population of 1.1 billion and about 60% of the net sown area depend on rains. An erratic monsoon like this year\u2019s affects crops and in many states farmers are already facing large-scale crop losses.\nWanted desperately: lush green landscapes with waterfalls; here in Khandala:Photo: \nImage: Anil R.\nAlready, experts are predicting a monsoon that\u2019s below normal, with rainfalls of up to 81% less in certain areas. This could affect agricultural output and push up food prices. Said Mridul Saggar, chief economist at Kotak Securities, in Thursday\u2019s Hindustan Times: \u201cIf you see a poor monsoon heading for a 10 per cent deficiency, you might see a 1 percentage drop in GDP.\u201d     \nEven during the monsoon, predicting daily rainfall and timings as accurately as possible is crucial because as seen in Mumbai and Maharashtra in July 2005, heavy rainfalls can be deadly. On 26th July, heavy rains caused by a cloudburst coincided with high tide in Mumbai, meaning that the excess water had nowhere to go as the tide was pushing in. This caused a deluge in Mumbai that left millions stranded and hundreds dead. \nThe Mumbai deluge on 26th July 2005:Photo: \nImage via desiprimeminister\nTo prevent such a disaster in the future, the powers that be in Mumbai decided to buy a Doppler radar system for $2 million that would allow accurate monsoon predictions to be made. It finally arrived at the South Mumbai offices of the Indian Meteorological Department in April this year, imported from China. Unfortunately, this is where it will stay during this year\u2019s monsoon \u2013 safe and sound in its boxes. No accurate predictions for you, Mumbai, again. Why? one may rightfully ask. \nAccording to RV Sharma, deputy director of the Indian Meteorology Department (western region), quoted in Hindustan Times on 23 June, because \u201cthe installation can only be done by specialised technicians. We do not have a timeline as of now.\u201d And said specialised technicians are still in China \u2013 where they will be until the timeline arrives. Furthermore, that would be after the monsoon because the long-awaited rains finally arrived in the city on Wednesday.  \nSource: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
