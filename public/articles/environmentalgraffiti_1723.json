Street artist and photographer Slinkachu magnifies our big city experiences by shrinking the actors. He recreates city scenes for one-inch tall plastic figures \u2013 his \u201clittle people\u201d \u2013  photographs them, and then leaves them to either be found by surprised passers-by or swept away by the elements.The \"scene\" for the little people...Photo: \n... and the same \"scene\" for the big ones:Photo: \n\u201cSlinkachu\u201d is the pseudonym of a clever London-based street artist and photographer who has been creating \u201clittle people\u201d-city scenes since 2006 in London, Manchester, Stavanger, Amsterdam and Barcelona. He might copy a given scene, for example an entrance to a church or house, or create new cityscapes by finding uses for everyday objects for his underground population \u2013 for instance by turning an orange peel into a half pipe for a tiny skateboarder.\nFar from just being cute, urban angst is all the more real for the little people who, as the artist describes his installations, are \u201clittle handpainted people, left in London to fend for themselves.\u201d So while surprised bystanders might be going \u201cawwww\u2026\u201d, they will soon discover that the little people deal with big city issues not unlike their own: a sense of being lost, loneliness, melancholy and abandonment. But, just like any city dweller, the little people are tough and make the best of city life: they find opportunity in everything, even trash; they find beauty in the urban jungle and keep their sense of humour.\nAnd this \u2013 emphasizing and being able to laugh at one\u2019s situation, together with having an awareness of one\u2019s surroundings \u2013 is what Slinkachu essentially wants to convey:\n\n\n\"Cash mashine\":Photo: \nSometimes, the artist does check back on an installation and might create a new context. The one below, developed one and a half years after the original with a new plastic figure, is now titled \"Vandalised cash mashine\":\nOh, and when not roaming the streets, Slinkachu makes sure the little people don\u2019t take over his space: \u201cMany of the little people live under my bed where I force them into hard labour cleaning crumbs from my floor.\u201d\nAnd yes, little people need to earn a living just like big ones. Maybe they would get inspired by our article on living statues? Or the one where their close relatives, the Lego figures, hijacked a power plant? Or maybe that's just putting ideas in their heads.\nSource: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
