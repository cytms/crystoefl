Now this necessity is illustrated by a stylish website designed by Australian\u2019s leading national not-for profit environment organisation.\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation has developed an online tool, the \u201cconsumption atlas\u201d, which maps patterns of consumption and environmental impact across Australia. It illustrates how much water and land is required, and the levels of greenhouse gas emissions produced, by the variety of lifestyles across Australia.  Individuals can view the pollution levels caused by their town and use the \u201ceco-calculator\u201d to assess where they fit into the pattern and what their lifestyle costs in terms of resources. The consumption atlas follows a report titled \u201cConsuming Australia\u201d which is based on research by the University  of Sydney\u2019s Centre for Integrated Sustainability Analysis and studies spending patterns and sustainability.\nInterestingly, the report concludes that it is spending that is the biggest contributor to the pollution levels of an individual household, rather than energy use.  It concludes:\n\u201cThis report has highlighted the crucial relative importance of consumption of food and other consumer products, which far outweigh the direct impacts of energy and water use in the average Australian home. Further, it demonstrates the strong and troubling link between increased wealth and increased environmental impact.\u201d\n\u201cOver-consumption is costing us the earth,\u201d commented Chuck Berger, ACF\u2019s Director of Sustainability Strategies. \u201cUse of electricity in the home accounts for just 15 per cent of the greenhouse pollution each of us creates. The majority is created indirectly from the production and transportation of all the things we are buying.\u201d\nRicher areas were shown to pollute substantially more than less affluent suburbs, because households typically buy more and travel by air more often.  Berger explains that \u201cIt is better to spend more of our money on services - from sporting-event tickets to massages - because services in general demand fewer resources than goods.\u201d\nACF is encouraging householders to be smarter with how they spend their money, and to consider the impact of their purchasing behaviour on the environment. \u201cPeople can make a difference to their individual contribution to greenhouse pollution by buying less, wasting less and choosing products that last,\u201d Mr Berger concluded.\nSources include: Consuming Australia;  ACF Consumption Atlas\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.
