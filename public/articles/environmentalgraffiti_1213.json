Known as the opal capital of the world, in amongst its disused mine shafts you\u2019ll find homes, hotels and even a church dug into the hillsides.\nDig a little deeper and aside from the benefit the sandstone has of keeping you cool, you\u2019ll find it's rather easy to fashion yourself an abode. Fancy an en suite bathroom? Don\u2019t put the shovel away just yet. How about some extra storage space?
