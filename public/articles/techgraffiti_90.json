Page\nThe \u201cAll-Seeing\u201d eye\nFiery spheres explode in showers of golden sparks, geometric shapes shimmer on sandy shores, and glowing light trails cut mesmerizing paths through dark forests. The light paintings of Jason D. Page are beautiful and otherworldly, but the whimsical-looking photographs don\u2019t reveal the hard work and even danger that Page goes through to get each perfect shot.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\nThe light trail version of the yellow brick road\n\u201cFor as long as I can remember I have had an interest in photography,\u201d Page tells us. \u201cWhat drew me to light painting was that it was a way for me to get images that have been locked inside my imagination out.\u201d Based on his creations, Page seems to have a brain that\u2019s brimming with vivid ideas.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\nThis pulsing purple light trail is hypnotic.\nAs any light painter will tell you, capturing these luminous figures, lines and shapes requires patience and persistence, and Page uses a technique called long-exposure photography. \u201cI lock the shutter of the camera open then go into the scene and literally paint with light,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy exposure times range from 30 seconds to 30 minutes or more.\u201d\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\nAn erupting fireball\nWhat makes Page\u2019s images especially incredible is that he doesn\u2019t perform any post-production to create them. \u201cAll of my images are created in real time and captured to the camera in one single photographic frame,\u201d he explains. The fireball pictured above is part of Page\u2019s \u201cPyrotechnics\u201d series.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cThe Machine\u201d\nPage says that drawing three-dimensional objects, like the one pictured above from his \u201cKinematics\u201d series, is one of the hardest things to do in light painting. In the trailer for his soon-to-be-released documentary Jason D. Page, Light Painter, Page explains that light painting is its own art form and not simply a technique. \u201cCalling light painting a photographic technique would be the same thing as calling painting a \u2018canvas technique,\u2019 or drawing a \u2018sketchpad technique\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cLong exposure slow shutter photography, that\u2019s the technique.\u201d\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cLeft Behind\u201d\nThis striking image, titled \u201cLeft Behind,\u201d is part of Page\u2019s \u201cPyrotechnics\u201d series. Page created these photographs by mixing a selection of chemicals and setting them on fire. As you might imagine, this can be quite dangerous; and according to Page, getting burnt goes with the territory.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cTropical Trail\u201d\nPage created his first light painting by accident. When he was photographing the sea at nighttime, he bumped his camera, causing moonlight to \u201cstreak across the sky.\u201d As you can see from looking at this light trail, he\u2019s come a long way since then, and setting up his shots has become a much more deliberate, time-consuming and methodical process.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cMoonrise Machines\u201d\nIn this photograph, three-dimensional domes within domes and crisscrossing lights illuminate a beach. The image is so intricate and detailed that we can only imagine the amount of time it must have taken Page to create. \u201cIf I get lucky I can get the image in a single night, but that rarely happens,\u201d Page tells us. \u201cI have a series that I am currently working on that I have been attempting for over two years, and I still have not created a single shot that I am happy with.\u201d\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\nAnother mesmerizing light trail snakes its way through the undergrowth.\nNext, a luminous path leads enticingly though the woods; you\u2019d never lose a trail this obvious. The image is part of Page\u2019s \u201cLight Trails\u201d series. Interestingly, Page holds that the bends in the series symbolize his own journey with light painting. He can\u2019t see what awaits him when he turns a corner, but he knows it will be meaningful. \u201cI don\u2019t know where light painting is going to take me, but I know there is something truly significant around the corner,\u201d says Page.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cHoppollia\u201d\nIn another shot from Page\u2019s \u201cPyrotechnics\u201d series, we see a blazing ball shimmering on the wet sand, as light streaks in every direction. Page loves creating the series and says, \u201cI enjoy the physical and chemical creation of these explosions of light.\u201d When you think about it, the beach is probably one of the safest places to create these fiery light paintings.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cMidnight Bliss\u201d\nPage\u2019s love of nature is apparent in almost all of his light paintings, including this one from his \u201cLandscape\u201d series. Tiny points of light twinkle like fireflies in the grass in the beautiful, ethereal-looking shot, titled \u201cMidnight Bliss.\u201d When we asked Page about the difficulties he faces, he replied, \u201cI live in South Florida and shoot most of my work outside in isolated places. Elements like the heat, the cold, the bugs, the snakes, the wild animals and the occasional weirdo that you run into at night are my most challenging aspects.\u201d\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cSpiral Trail\u201d\nHere\u2019s another image from Page\u2019s \u201cLight Trails\u201d series, this time featuring a giant spiral that snakes off into the distance. Light painting itself has a long history dating back to 1914, when motion study pioneers Frank Gilbreth and his wife Lillian left the shutter of a camera open to record the movements of small lights attached to manufacturing and clerical workers.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cPurple Fire Circle\u201d\nHere\u2019s another flaming shot from Page\u2019s combustible \u201cPyrotechnics\u201d series. This light painting reminds us of a pinwheel firecracker \u2013 or, from a distance, a peacock feather. Interestingly, for those human animals who value their body hair and safety, it\u2019s possible to create light paintings using glow sticks or torches.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cCubism\u201d\nA mysterious cube sits on the sand in this light painting from Page\u2019s \u201cKinematics\u201d series. The lines of the three-dimensional figure emanate small sparks that make it look like it has been illuminated with glowing fur. Page says he has shot thousands of three-dimensional shapes, but only a few have come out the way he wanted them to \u2013 which illustrates just how difficult these kinds of paintings are to produce. \u201cWhen you get it right, it is a great feeling,\u201d he says.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cRailroad Sphere\u201d\nThese tracks evidently don\u2019t see much action, since Page clearly had enough time to set up and execute this shot from his \u201cPyrotechnics\u201d series. We asked Page what the most challenge aspect of light painting is for him. \u201cGetting models to go out more than once,\u201d he replied, referring to his images that incorporate people. \u201cLight painting is a very time-consuming and boring process for the average person. I spend hours and hours shooting at night to maybe get just one single image. People will sometimes see my work and want to participate in a shoot \u2013 until they get out there into the swamp.\u201d\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\nAnother flaming fireball\nWith the sea dimly visible behind it, this glowing orb perched on a rocky shore looks like it was made from strands of shiny gold. For obvious reasons, light painting is usually done when it\u2019s dark. And Page, for one, finds the experience of shooting on a beach at night both relaxing and inspiring. Despite their volatile nature, there remains a tranquil beauty to his \u201cPyrotechnics\u201d images like this one.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\nAnother captivating light trail leads the way.\nThe swirly patterns and spirals that make up this beckoning light trail remind us of children playing with sparklers. Nighttime long-exposure photography often results in the surrounding environment taking on a strange feel that isn\u2019t quite day or night.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\nThis raging fireball looks particularly volatile.\nThe sparks are really flying in this image. It\u2019s amazing the different textures Page is able to paint within a single photograph, from the brooding glow of the central ring to the tiny points of bright light surrounding it.\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\nA red light trail lures us in.\nHere, a dazzling light trail of six lines leads off into the brush. Once more, the surroundings are bathed in an eerie long-exposure glow. Even the natural colors take on a surreal appearance. Page tells us that in the future he will be \u201cfocusing less on the technical complexity of an image and more on the story that the image tells.\u201d\nPhoto: Jason D. Page\n\u201cLunar Goddess\u201d\nPage\u2019s upcoming documentary, Jason D. Page, Light Painter, sounds like it\u2019s going to shed some light on the man and his art. \u201cThe documentary is something that I am very excited about. It will explain what light painting is, the process I use to create my images, and my personal story of how I became a light painter.\u201d You can see the trailer for the documentary here. We thank Jason D. Page for sharing his amazing work with us here at Tech Graffiti.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5","author":"Yohani Kamarudin","web_category":"productsgear","title":"Mysterious Fireballs Carve Through the Night","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/2013/03/light21.jpg","url":"http://www.techgraffiti.com/mysterious-light-trails-and-fireballs-carve-through-the-darkness"}
