Pots, pans, forks, kettles, hats or phones; you name the garage sale item and Eichenbaum's probably re-used it in his one-of-a-kind lamps. Quirky and fun, these lights will make for a wonderful addition to any home.\nEichenbaum first started making his charming lanterns during his travels, using his imagination to create useful objects out of limited but available resources \u2013 like making a lampshade out of a pot or a chair out of scrap wood. Eventually what started out as a hobby became a successful business as his artsy but useful lamps garnered interest from those around him.\nWe've gathered a few images of Eichenbaum's light fixtures here, but we encourage you to check out his website, or Greenupgrader, where there are many more unique creations.\nSources: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
