Would the prizes impact the going rates of each other?\nApparently, the meteorite, valued at over 2.5 million dollars, didn't sell. This may not be coming as a shock to you, but it probably should - dinosaur feces is fairly common, and it sold for double its recommended price, just under $1,000. The meteorite on the other hand, was found in the Chinese Gobi desert and is 4.5 billion years old. It is made of palasite, which is every bit as exotic and rare as it sounds.\nIt's an odd juxtaposition: feces selling for double its value, while a priceless relic; a chunk dating back to the creation of the universe was unable to meet the reserve price.\nNotwithstanding this, Bonham's claims that negotiations are underway with a potential buyer and that a deal could potentially be struck within days.\nSpeaking about the dinosaur excrement, Marvin Kilgore, the owner of the meteorite and Curator of the University of Arizona's Southwest Meteor Center, said that some people must \"want it on their shelf.\"\nInfo from: Yahoo News, National Geographic, Planet Ark, Meteorman, GizMag \nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
