In the years following his death at age 32, his opponents circulated defamatory stories about the last Plantagenet ruler, portraying him as a brutal tyrant suspected of killing his young nephews in the Tower of London. In the 1590s, William Shakespeare forever sealed Richard\u2019s reputation as murderous and corrupt by penning an eponymous play based on distorted accounts. At a time when physical deformities served as literary devices that conveyed a character\u2019s malevolence, the Bard and Richard\u2019s other critics described him as a hunchback with a withered arm.\nBut according to records from Richard\u2019s lifetime, the king was responsible for relatively progressive measures, including a system of legal aid for those who could not afford representation and protections for the accused. And to this day, no evidence exists linking the maligned ruler to the mysterious disappearance of his brother\u2019s sons, who never emerged from captivity.\nWith literary sources and official records painting a cloudy picture of the poorly understood medieval king, archaeologists are seeking more concrete answers in an unlikely spot: a parking lot in Leicester, England. It was here, experts believe, that a lost Franciscan friary known as Grey Friars\u2014thought to have been Richard III\u2019s final resting place\u2014once stood. With support from the University of Leicester, the Leicester City Council and the Richard III Society, archaeologists broke ground at the lot on August 24, digging two trenches in hopes of unearthing medieval walls.\nBefore the project began, University of Leicester archaeologist Richard Buckley said that finding Richard III\u2019s remains was a \u201clong shot\u201d but would represent a historically significant discovery. \u201cWe want to find Richard III really because he\u2019s the last king to have died on the field of battle in Britain,\u201d he explained in a video released by the school. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the few monarchs where we have no idea precisely where his burial place is.\u201d\nJust three weeks into the excavation, that might have changed. After unearthing what appear to be a medieval church and garden on the site, archaeologists announced today that they have now exhumed two sets of human remains. One of them has been identified as female, but the other \u201cis the right sort of candidate to be Richard III,\u201d according to Buckley. At a press conference held in Leicester today, he and his colleagues revealed that the male skeleton appears to have suffered skull trauma consistent with a battle injury and has an arrowhead lodged in its vertebrae. What\u2019s more, the individual had a spinal curvature likely caused by scoliosis\u2014not, as Shakespeare would have us believe, the condition known as kyphosis, which creates a rounded or \u201chumpbacked\u201d spine. There was also no evidence of the malformed arm Shakespeare described.\nThe male remains were found within the church\u2019s choir, which according to reports was indeed the exact site of Richard III\u2019s grave. Still, experts warned against jumping to conclusions before laboratory tests\u2014including DNA analysis\u2014are completed. \u201cWe are not saying that we have found Richard III,\u201d Richard Taylor, director of corporate affairs at the University of Leicester, cautioned reporters. \u201cWhat we are saying is that the search for Richard III has entered a new phase. Our focus is shifting from the archaeological excavation to laboratory analysis.\u201d\nIf researchers manage to recover DNA from the male skeleton, they will test it against samples from Michael Ibsen, a Canadian-born furniture maker thought to be descended from Richard III. Historians believe his mother was the 16th great-grandniece of the king\u2019s oldest sister, Anne of York. \u201cNeedless to say this is an extremely exciting project to be involved with and I\u2019m very hopeful that we can bring DNA evidence to bear on the question as to whether or not this is indeed Richard III,\u201d geneticist Turi King of the University of Leicester said at the press conference.\nBuckley noted that, while the discovery of Grey Friars alone is a major achievement, the positive identification of Richard III\u2019s remains would have a special meaning for both archaeologists and the public. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual to do archaeology which you can associate with a known individual,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really sort of brings it to life. Usually we dig up many, many burials who will always remain nameless, and you can\u2019t relate to them quite the same way. Because this could be Richard III, it humanizes the story.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"King Richard III\u2019s Body Found Under Parking Lot?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/richard-iii.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/king-richard-iiis-body-found-under-parking-lot"}
