Citrus smells would make you alert \u2013 warm, soft aromas relaxed you\u2013or set you up for a shock. By and large, people hated it. Not just because their television smelled, but because they weren\u2019t smelling what was on screen, they were smelling what behavioral scientists said might go well with what was on screen. With the help of the first ever smell map, we\u2019re beginning to figure out how to fix that.\nAlmonds smell more like roses than they do bananas. Smell has universal laws, made up of over 1,600 chemical characteristics that define the components of what we previously thought was an entirely subjective experience. From those components come approximately 40 traits that the brain uses to decode smells\u2013and that Rafi Haddad and David Harel at the Weitzmann Institute could use to form a map.\nIn the course of verifying their map, Harel and Haddad also sought to produce their own synthesized smells\u2013a series of 70 that, according to the map, they could predict how people would react to. The results were very closely matching what was expected, and that\u2019s where our good friend smell-o-vision comes in.\nSynthesizing smells has always been next to impossible because the chemical traits of smells are extremely difficult to isolate. With the reduction to 40 traits, instead of countless individual smells, it\u2019s at least once again plausible to have a working TV that broadcasts smells into your home.
