For the first time, scientists have used DNA extracted from victims of the pandemic, buried in London around its height in 1348, to sequence their virulent killer\u2019s complete genome. The team\u2019s findings strengthen the case implicating Yersinia pestis and, more strikingly, suggest that all modern strains of the microbe evolved from the medieval bug.\n\u201cThe data that we\u2019ve collected for this particular paper reveals something very fascinating about the origins of plague,\u201d explained co-author Hendrik Poinar, an evolutionary geneticist at McMaster University in Canada. \u201cThey show that the medieval plague of 1348 London is the ancestor of all modern plagues that we have in existence around the world today. That means a plague outbreak in India last year, one in Africa not that long ago and one very recently in Colorado all have their origins in London 1348, in the midst of the Black Death.\u201d\nThe Black Death spread faster, further and with more ruinous consequences than today\u2019s plagues, which affect 2,000 people per year and typically respond to antibiotics. For this reason, some have pinned the medieval scourge on either a more powerful form of Yersinia pestis or another disease entirely, such as hemorrhagic fever. But the latest study revealed a striking similarity between the germ\u2019s ancient and current incarnations, Poinar said.\n\u201cWe found that in 660 years of evolution as a human pathogen, there have been relatively few changes in the genome of the ancient organism, but those changes, however small, may or may not account for the noted increased virulence of the bug that ravaged Europe,\u201d he said. External factors specific to the people of the Middle Ages\u2014including low resistance, poor hygiene and malnutrition\u2014could also be to blame, the study\u2019s authors have suggested.\nIn addition to comparing it with modern variations, the researchers used genomic data to calculate the age of the Yersinia pestis strain that ostensibly maxed out Europe\u2019s cemeteries in the mid-1340s. They determined that it originated shortly before the Black Death broke out, calling into question assumptions that the so-called Justinian plague of the sixth century shared the same cause. This revised timeline could mean that the immune systems of people in the 14th century\u2014like those of Native Americans exposed to smallpox by Europeans\u2014had not yet adapted to fend off the disease.\nThe paper\u2019s authors consider it a \u201clandmark\u201d because it represents the first time scientists have reconstructed the complete genome of an ancient pathogen from fossilized remains. To accomplish this, they developed a groundbreaking method for extracting tiny fragments of DNA from ancient specimens\u2014in this case, dental pulp from graves in London\u2019s East Smithfield burial ground, which was created specifically for plague victims. This approach could pave the way for further research on past diseases, how they evolved and whether they\u2019re likely to return. \u201cIt is important to study ancient pathogens because, in a lot of cases, diseases, such as the plague, turn out to be emerging or reemerging infections,\u201d Poinar said.\nBarney Sloane, an archaeologist who wrote a book about the Black Death based on archival research, said that the new study adds to mounting evidence that Yersinia pestis caused the medieval pandemic but does not confirm the hypothesis. He pointed out that the bacterium might be lurking in skeletal remains buried before the 1340s, which could mean it was present but not the primary offender. \u201cTo make the assumption that Yersinia pestis was the 1348 killer without testing pre-1348 mass graves to the same degree as the East Smithfield study has done seems to me to leave a rather awkward scientific stone unturned,\u201d he said.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Is the Black Death the Ancestor of All Modern Plagues?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/skeletal_remains.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/is-the-black-death-the-ancestor-of-all-modern-plagues"}
