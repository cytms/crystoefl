The artist is Are Mokkelbost, a young talent from Oslo, Norway. His collages have been on view in Oslo and Paris and are currently making the blog circles. For those who really can\u2019t believe that Mokkelbost\u2019s creations are not paintings, read on for proof\u2026\nMokkelbost's ION-OMNI No. 08, paper collage, 90 x 60 cm: Photo: \nMokkelbost\u2019s ION-OMNI series, which he created between 2005 and 2008, is what currently fascinates art lovers and the public alike. His pictures emit a raw energy that is contained only by the medium of collage: random pieces of paper, determined by the artist\u2019s vision, are put together to create these strangely beautiful images. They are like fires made of geometrical shapes that have the power, phoenix like, to create life \u2013 strange heads of hair that become the fire rather than being destroyed by it.     \nMokkelbost even displays what is usually hidden from viewers: the back of the artwork. In his case, the question \"How does he do it?\" gets answered and makes his artworks even more interesting.   \nION-OMNI No. 02, front and back:Photo: \nAccording to his web site, here's how Mokkelbost worked on the ION collages: \nThe artist at work on the ION series in his studio in Oslo:Photo: \nImage: Pal Laukli\nFor the group poster and video exhibition \"Giving People What They Want\" in 2006 at Glassbox in Paris, Mokkelbost scanned the back and front of this only 10 x 4 cm paper collage and then enlarged it to poster size. It's amazing how back and front blend together to create what one could call a psychedelic Rorschach-Test. \nHere's an earlier work from Mokkelbost's 2003 group exhibition \"Let's Get Physical\" in Oslo, using posters, paper collage, spray paint, paper and a light box:\nMokkelbost, who graduated from Oslo\u2019s National Academy of the Arts in 2002, seems to be an all-rounder: He records and performs his own music as well. It\u2019s understood that he\u2019s doing his own album cover art. \nHe is currently in New York and can be seen at a group exhibition of Norwegian artists from March 5th to 8th at the Pulse Art Fair and Chashama in New York. \nWe first spotted Are Mokkelbost on booooooom.com. \nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
