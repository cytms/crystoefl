This is just a step forward in trying to reduce the amount of emissions in agriculture and more studies are done to change methods of fertilizing the soil.\nSo that we put the significance of this new breakthrough into context, the Environmental Protection Agency says cows are responsible for about 80 million metric tons of methane gas each year. That\u2019s equivalent to 28% of total global methane emissions. In the U.S. alone, cattle produce 5.5 million metric tons of gas a year \u2013 let\u2019s not even bring in China to the equation: ?in the last three years they\u2019ve have tripled their milk demands.\nDifferent solutions are being tested in various countries. A new tax in Estonia was approved just last month, meaning that farmers will have to pay extra for cow farts. But as the world food crisis worsens, is this the best way to proceed?\nWe don\u2019t think so - that\u2019s why we\u2019re extremely pleased with the new breakthrough. If we\u2019re to combat the effects of global warming, perhaps the best way is through technology.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Vlad Jecan","web_category":"nature","title":"Cow Farts and their Apocalyptic Effects","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/pb1_0.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/sciencetech/cow-farts-apocalyptic-effects/1275"}
