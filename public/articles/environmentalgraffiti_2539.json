It's just got so many wacky articles that its hard not to love. That being said, we can't help but look at it through our environmentalist eyes and see just a few ways Digg could go greener.\n\n1.  Go black\nMy friend Jane always told me that \u201cOnce you go black, you never go back.\u201d She was right of course, and since I\u2019ve made the switch I\u2019ve never been tempted to go back. I changed to Black Google(http://black-google.blogspot.com/) earlier this year. Estimates show that running black Google could save 750 megawatt hours a year. Switch to Black Digg and who knows how much energy you could save. \n\n\n2. Bump up Environment\u2019s Profile\nEnvironment on Digg as it stands is a dinky little backwater of Science. Let\u2019s raise people\u2019s awareness of Environment on Digg. Give Environment its own section on the main bar, maybe between technology and science.\n3. Eco-hosting\nDigg could switch to a company that either promotes carbon neutrality and environmental issues in the workplace (planting trees with hosting fees, having massive recycling programs, etc.) or donates a portion of its hosting fees to green organizations. \n4. Green Office\nWe couldn\u2019t find much information about the Digg offices themselves, but since we saw no mention of them as an ecologically friendly headquarters, we\u2019re going to assume they aren\u2019t. Making your office green can be a huge step towards being a carbon neutral company, and a lot of steps are easier than you think. Check out our article on setting up a recycling program in your office for tips.  \n5. Boatloads of money\nAs you may have noticed, a lot of these tips aren\u2019t just things Digg could do to go greener, but all of us on a smaller scale. That includes number one. We\u2019d love Digg to donate a boatload, or maybe even just a small truckload, of cash to any eco-charity it so chooses, and we\u2019d love it even more if you did the same. There are a ridiculous number of non-profits out there working to heal the planet which need your support. We\u2019re going to give some ourselves, and we hope you do too. \n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"5 Ways Digg Could Go Greener","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/7-foods_veggies.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/5-ways-digg-could-go-greener/346"}
