However, now international researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia have found BPA deposits in human tissue, at 10 times the acceptable concentration levels.\nThe team reviewed more than 700 studies, and found that levels in human tissue could reach 0.5mg per kilo of body weight, 10 times higher than the safety level set by the Environmental Protection Agency in the US.\nLead author Frederick vom Saal told New Scientist magazine that the effect of this \u201cextensive and continuous exposure\u201d to BPA could not be dismissed as harmless, and that it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the EFSA to continue to pretend that BPA is safe.\nHe now plans to investigate the original EFSA report to discover if it was influenced by external interests, an allegation which the Authority has strongly denied.","author":"Maryking","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Plastic bottles - are they really safe?","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Eye21_0.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/green-living/plastic-bottles-are-they-really-safe/189"}
