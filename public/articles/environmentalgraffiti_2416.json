Sunrays and shades of green, instead of flashing beacons and scarlet \u2018sale\u2019 signs \u2013 and I like it!\nSuch space is a rarity even living away from a large city \u2013 nature is defaced with industrial eyesores \u2013 but why? Because of our lifestyles of course!  I feel lost, but free, without my mobile phone; as though a limb has been severed if I\u2019m without my Apple Mac. Long before the birth of the Mac, the word \u2018apple\u2019 was the name of a beautiful fruit, full of energy and crunch; the forbidden fruit that tempted Adam out of the Garden of Eden \u2013 and now we are tempted by the slim-line, user-friendly, stylish laptop. Apple is a proper noun that names a piece of technology, synonymous with speed and efficiency, words that rule our lives on a day-to-day basis.\nPhoto: Jordan Daniels\nBorn and bred in London, I love it, but have chosen to move away from the intense activity and industrialized air.  I guess I just want my son to grow up around trees and lakes, as opposed to tower blocks and shop windows. Nicknamed the 'Great Smoke\u2019, it certainly gives Concrete Jungle a run for its money. Yet what I cannot understand about the Big Apple (again, I am not referring to the fruit) is that steam comes out of the ground \u2013 so I would be strolling through the Claustrophobic streets of New York and jump out of my size-6 heels every two minutes with the gusts of steam which would sporadically startle me from dodging a million taxis decorating the streets with yellow.  \nHong Kong taxis are a moving advert \u2013 but in Hong Kong there is advertising everywhere.  It is a place with a culture alien to me \u2013 but I still like it.  It is beautiful but for all of the wrong reasons: so many high buildings that climb into the clouds, not so that you can lie down and dream away your worries on floating cotton wool, but because the country is overpopulated, so in order to accommodate the masses the buildings go up instead of across.  \nPhoto: Jordan Daniels\nThere are some parks and trees in Hong Kong but everything is overlooked by very, very tall buildings; there just isn\u2019t enough land. The signs and advertising make me feel like I have been placed in a set of a movie. It is the only place I have ever visited that has more activity than London at a deadly hour of the morning.  \nPhoto: Jordan Daniels\nThere is no denying that no matter what we do we are constantly affecting the environment \u2013 and I am not preaching as I would be a hypocrite \u2013 but if you make a point of taking time out every so often to stand in the middle of a field without your phone, a laptop or even an iPod, you will soon realize that you can still breathe.","author":"portalpr","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Escaping the Concrete Jungle","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/7-foods_veggies.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/green-living/news-have-you-ever-just-stood-centre-field-london-new-york-hong-kong"}
