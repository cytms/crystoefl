Used to attract tourists as a roadside display, advertise local businesses, or experiment with really tall sculptures, water towers are a fun way for a town to express itself. However, for towns with bizarre characters, water towers are particularly weird.\n1. Leaning Tower of Niles, Illinois Photo: \n\nPhotograph: Kestenbaum\n\nThe Leaning Tower of Niles was built in 1934 by business tycoon Robert Ilg as the centerpiece for a recreational center for his employees.

Peachoid in Cherokee County, South CarolinaPhoto: \n\nPhotograph: Ken Thomas\n\nThe Peachoid was built in 1981 when the city of Gaffney, South Carolina needed a water tower.

House in the Clouds, England\nPhotograph: Solipsist \nIn 1923, the people of Thorpeness, Suffolk were not thrilled that a water tower was being constructed, obstructing their countryside views.
