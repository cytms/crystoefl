An idea for a 1000-m, tall man-made mountain branded The Berg has been put forward by zany architect Jacob Tigges. Complete with verdant alpine slopes and a winter snow-capped peak, The Berg is being billed as Berlin\u2019s next big thing \u2013 an iconic landmark beyond belief.\nThe Berg would be built on the site of Berlin\u2019s now closed Tempelhof Airport, obliterating the historic but disused transport hub in the way only a massive mountain can. In 2008, the demolition of the airport \u2013 identified by Nazi architect supremo Albert Speer as key to Berlin's reconstruction and designed during the late 1930s \u2013 divided the German capital, but there seem few such split loyalties over the building of The Berg. \nSkiing is one of the big anticipated attractions, and the idea has already received support from Berliners \u2013 not to mention globetrotting fans on Facebook thrilled at the prospect of jetting over to Berlin for some en piste action. The German press seem particularly enamoured with the concept, with some publications waxing lyrical as if The Berg has already become a reality. \n\u201cSome people think that The Berg has not yet come into existence,\u201d mused Berlin art and fashion mag Sleek. \u201cBut The Berg doesn\u2019t need rock from Austria or construction technologies from Japan to exist... This is a special mountain, a mountain that can grow... But there\u2019s a problem: The Berg can only be seen at its full size when you know that it can grow, and it can only grow when you see it at its full size.\u201d Indeed.\nSomething isn\u2019t right here \u2013 and it\u2019s no wonder the noises from some quarters are that the whole business is one giant-sized joke. \u201cWe\u2019re all about adding green space to urban environments,\u201d declared Inhabitat. \u201cBut devoting an enormous amount of time, energy and resources into a gigantic landmass that isn\u2019t even inhabitable on the inside seems like a huge mound of you-know-what.\u201d The only thing is \u2013 the signs are that it was meant that way.\nOne commenter reckoned \u201cthe entire project is intended as a tongue-in-cheek artistic/political statement. It\u2019s a satirical jab at local Berlin politicians for their lack of imagination in determining a future for the Tempelhof airport property.\u201d Read the Berg\u2019s manifesto and it certainly sounds ironic, taking swipes at cities around the globe hungry for high-rises and hotels, plus the envy and Middle Eastern copies The Berg will inspire.\nThe people behind The Berg are perhaps at their most frank when they describe it as a project \u201cat the intersection of architecture, contemporary art and photography.\u201d We are in a peculiarly postmodern place where the boundaries blur \u2013 between different disciplines and, yes, between fact and fiction too. Is it all an elaborate hoax? To be honest we don\u2019t care. If it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s a pretty inspiring pipe dream, and if it is it sure as a sugar heap fooled a few folks.\nYou can check out The Berg's website here.
