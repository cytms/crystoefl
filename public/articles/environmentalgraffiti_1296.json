But wait... before you slam the kids in that minivan and speed off: there's a greener way.\n5.  Don't Travel As Far\nIn one of those special instances where environmentalism saves you a ton of money, the simplest piece of advice is one that most Americans aren't likely to follow, even in this hour of $4.00 gasoline:  stay close to home.  Heck, even stay home:  if you live in a major city, there are probably loads of museums, parks, baseball games, and restaurants that you haven't been to.  But if you MUST travel-- try to stay within 100-150 miles of home.  Your wallet, and the planet, will thank you.\nPhoto: Image from Stuckincustoms on Flickr\n4.  Find A Green Hotel\nThis may seem like a monstrous task, but it's not-- check this registry of environmentally friendly hotels.  They're standing ready to assist in your eco-escape, conserving waste, and committed to reducing their toll on the planet.\nPhoto: Image from Flickr\n3.  Take the Train\nRail travel isn't quite dead in the U.S., which is good, because it features some of the lowest carbon emissions per-traveler of any form of transport.  In order of most polluting, it goes: airplanes, cars, trains, and coach buses--but I don't know many people who think of Greyhound as a good way to get around anymore.  \"Boost that failing government-subsidized rail system, America!\"\nPhoto: Image from Flickr\n2.  Buy Local Souveneirs\nThis is hard, seeing as how we're nationally addicted to airbrushed t-shirts and plastic toys, but buy local goods when you travel.  Supporting a local artist doesn't just do more for the economy of the place that you're visiting, it cuts the cost of transporting all of those mass-produced tourist trap souvenirs.   And besides, taking home art, or cooking ingredients from a place you can't get at home, is far more interesting.\nPhoto: Image from Flickr\n1.  Minimize Waste\nI know, that seems like a gimme-- but it's not.  Turn off your thermostat when you're not home.  Take the pets to a sitter, or board them, rather than leaving them in the house with some neighbor stopping in to check on them.  Pack a couple of water bottles so you don't have to buy bottles of water everywhere you go.  Common sense still applies on vacation, as odd as that seems.Photo: Image from Flickr\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
