Then folding the paper in the middle, pressing hard and opening it to find a strange creation that often resembled a butterfly? Well, nature does the same thing with water reflections, only much more beautifully. The Rorschach inkblot test uses our imagination for psychological evaluation \u2013 so be careful who you share your observations with!\nSays photographer Richard about his image above: \u201cThe conditions were perfect with no breeze at all. All I had to do was point and click. The reflection has not been tampered with at all - honest!!!\u201d\nRotate the image left and you get a sad elephant. Or the back of a sabertooth tiger?Photo: \nWhat do YOU see and what does that say about you?\nThis image looks like the classic Inkblot Test \u2013 what do you see?Photo: \nImage: Todd Kulesza\nNo need to see a shrink if you didn\u2019t guess the Willamette River in Oregon:Photo: \nLike the popular children\u2019s water colour activity, 19th century society was crazy about a game that revolved around the interpretation of inkblots. Before that, Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli had played around with using a person\u2019s interpretation of \"ambiguous designs\" to assess his or her personality. Often it\u2019s just a question of perspective.\nTake this pond reflection captured close to Bergen, Norway for example:Photo: \nImage: Magnera\nWhat do you see now? Two monkeys kissing or an hourglass?Photo: \nSwiss psychologist Herrmann Rorschach was the first to develop the inkblot method systematically by developing a set of ten cards with inkblots and a psychological evaluation scale in 1921.\nToday, the Rorschach test is ranked eighth among psychological tests used in the United States. About 80% of psychology graduate programs teach it and it is used in surveys and assessments by around 20% of correctional psychologists, 25% of psychiatrists in forensics and 80% of clinical psychologists.\nWe\u2019ll show you 20 images, so let\u2019s continue with our free association phase.\nThis pinball wizard can be found at\u2026Photo: \nImage: Paul Sapiano\n\u2026 Disney\u2019s California Adventure Park:Photo: \nHere\u2019s Munch\u2019s \u201eScream\u201d recreated in trees with red glowing eyes:Photo: \nImage: Kamil Porembinski \nWho would\u2019ve thought it\u2019s harmless Poniatowski Park in Lodz, Poland?Photo: \nAnd, staying with famous painters, ceci n\u2019est ce pas un museum:Photo: \nImage: Anders Rasmussen\nOh yes, it is, the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, but not designed by Magritte:Photo: \nWhere the wild things are\u2026Photo: \nImage: Jurek Durczak\n\u2026crooked trees in Victoria, Australia:Photo: \nThe Green Giant or something more suggestive?

Other than it still being highly suggestive. No? Then look at the water. It\u2019s a fountain, right? So why are there no ripples in the lake from the fountain water coming down? Hmm\u2026\nSays photographer David Paul Ohmer: \u201cThis fountain kicks on at 7:30 am. Once the water rises I have to take the picture before it falls and disturbs the reflection below. I have about 8 seconds to do this before the water ripples arrive. This shot only lasts about 8 seconds all day.\u201d\nWow, that\u2019s what we call perfect timing!\nIs this housing complex in New York\u2019s urban jungle seen through a cab window on a rainy day? Photo: \nImage: John Lewis\nNope, it was actually upside down; it\u2019s reflected in a puddle:Photo: \nIs this an ant with square eyes?

And what\u2019s the verdict? Sane or insane? We\u2019ll conclude with Rorschach\u2019s words about the test evaluation: \u201cThe interpretation of a Rorschach record is a complex process. It requires a wealth of knowledge concerning personality dynamics generally as well as considerable experience with the Rorschach method specifically.\u201d\nExactly, so this is all fun!
