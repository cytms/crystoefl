Documentation dating back to the times of the New Testament exists that lists all the ways it was used by ancient Greeks, Romans and Egyptians.\nThe symptoms of stomach upset, insomnia, colds and flu are among the most common German Chamomile is known to alleviate. But modern medicine is recognizing the healing properties of German Chamomile in some not so common ways.\nOral mucositis is often a side effect of receiving chemotherapy to the head or neck. Inflamation and ulceration inside the mouth occur causing significant pain and discomfort. But because of the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties in German Chamomile it has been successful in alleviating the pain and discomfort when it is made into a tea and used as a mouthwash.\nGerman Chamomile is easy to grow. It can be grown nearly anywhere in the United States. Sprinkle the seeds from two dried flowers over loose soil and cover with a thin layer of dirt. Then water lightly. Seeds take about a week to germinate and then small sprouts begin to appear that look a great deal like carrot tops at the beginning.","author":"Michele L Langlo","web_category":"nature","title":"The Healing Properties of German Chamomile","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Jewelweed.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-healing-properties-german-chamomile"}
