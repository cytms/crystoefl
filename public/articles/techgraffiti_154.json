This modified military jumbo jet is equipped with the latest in airborne laser weapons technology, for identifying, tracking and shooting down missile threats.\nThe YAL-1 Airborne Laser (ABL) has been some twelve years in the making. Now, after various stages of testing and the odd hold-up, it looks likely to be given the green light for an in-flight missile shoot-down sometime in 2009.\nSeekin\u2019 and a-destroyin\u2019: artist\u2019s impression of the airborne laser in actionPhoto: Image: Missile Defense Agency\nThe ABL is a megawatt-class chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL), assisted by six infrared sensors and two kilowatt-class solid-state lasers. Watt? Basically, the ABL\u2019s infrared sensors detect the bright hot exhaust plume of a missile that\u2019s boosting off up to a few hundred kilometres away. Within seconds, the two lower-powered lasers track the missile\u2019s course and pinpoint an impact spot, while adapting to atmospheric distortions like air turbulence.\nMoments later, in comes the big gun, the COIL itself, which is made up of six SUV-sized modules to the rear of the plane. The laser beam travels down the length of the aircraft, the huge turret in the nose swivels towards the target, and telescope mirrors inside steer the beam onto the missile. It fires for three to five seconds, heating and softening the missile\u2019s shell so that \u2013 boom! \u2013 it blows up mid-flight. Cue the high fives and victory whoops.\nIs that a gun in your cockpit? The ABL\u2019s turret, reckoned to be the world\u2019s largestPhoto: Image: Missile Defense Agency\nBut are there any drawbacks to this missile-zapping laser, for the environment and for people?\nThe directed-energy laser is fed with a compact mixture of chemicals not unlike rocket propellant. To get the COIL\u2019s iodine molecules excited and emitting the photons that do the damage, they\u2019re mixed with hydrogen peroxide and potassium hydroxide \u2013 chemicals found in hair bleach and drain cleaner. Chlorine gas is used too \u2013 nasty stuff employed in warfare for its noxious effects \u2013 but traces of it are said to be removed from the exhaust gases. Not exactly rose water, then, but not quite mustard gas either.\nAccording to one report, during a five second burst the high-octane laser produces enough energy to power an average American home for over an hour. This may not seem dazzlingly energy efficient; but once it has been built, firing such a pure energy weapon carries a fraction of the energy cost of launching equivalent missiles, with the extra resources and fuel they require. A fraction of the actual cost too, so good news for the military budgeters.\nYou know, Bill, that thing kinda reminds me a something: laser turret exposedPhoto: Image: Credit: Air Force photo by Bobby Jones\nSo what else might this sharp-shooting addition to the missile defense system have its sights trained on?\nThough the laser could be deployed against other aircraft, their jets probably wouldn\u2019t give off enough heat to be detected effectively by the ABL\u2019s infrared sensors. Elsewhere, ground targets would be tricky to track; and firing the laser down through the atmosphere would weaken the beam \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t be potent enough to penetrate tough armoured vehicles. That said, somewhat more ominous plans are afoot to expand the ABL\u2019s scope against other traditional targets. Watch this airspace; just be sure to wear your mirrored shades.\nCollateral damage, meanwhile, should in theory be minimised by the ABL\u2019s surgically precise targeting. However, there is the rather less surgically precise danger of debris from destroyed missiles falling on civilians in enemy territory and people in nearby countries. There\u2019s also the small chance of birds flying into the 1.5m-diameter laser beam and being vaporised \u2013 particularly as it\u2019s invisible to the naked eye \u2013 though the risk should be reduced by the brief duration for which it\u2019s fired. Some comfort for ornithologists then.\nShoot to missile-kill: the ABL in flightPhoto: Image: US AirForce\nThough it might not exactly be on every environmentalist\u2019s New Year wish list, with its lethal speed of light capabilities the ABL is sure to be a smash hit with the gung-ho as well as the Star Wars geeks. Stay on target.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
