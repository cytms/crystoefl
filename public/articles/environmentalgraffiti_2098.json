Today however, Friday 13th June 2008 is the day the well-known American brand makes history: Doritos has teamed up with astronomers to broadcast their advertising into space. The ad is being pulsed over a 6-hour period from the radars of the EISCAT European space station in the Arctic Circle.\nThe transmission is part of a bigger project entitled the Doritos Broadcast Project, during which the company invited the UK public to produce a snap-shot of life on Earth to be sent into space. The winning ad \"Tribe\", as voted by the British public, is directed by 25-year-old Matt Bowron. Watch it below:\nThe ad depicts a tribe of Doritos escaping from the pack and sacrificing a member of their tribe to the God of Salsa. The ad is available online, at the Doritos website, and will be broadcasted on ITV, during the Euro 2008 semi-final game on Sunday 15th June @ 7.44pm.\nEISCAT Director, Professor Tony van Eyken who oversaw the transmission said: \u201cThe signal is directed at a solar system just 42 light years away from Earth, in the \u2018Ursa Major\u2019 or Great Bear Constellation. Its star is very similar to our Sun and hosts a habitable zone that could harbour small life supporting planets similar to ours.\u201d\nIt's an historic day for all of us. No doubt about it. We must ask ourselves - what will ET think when it receives a broadcast about some dancing potato chips? Let\u2019s just hope we don\u2019t get invaded.\nInformation Via Frank PR\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
