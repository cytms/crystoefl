Their pop-inspired ideas of mobility \u2013 walking cities in particular \u2013 and radical urban design have inspired many contemporary architects and continue to inspire futuristic designs today. Follow us on a magical mystery Archigram design tour.    \nLondon-based architects Warren Chalk, Peter Cook, Dennis Crompton, David Greene, Ron Herron and Michael Webb formed the collective Archigram that, after humble beginnings, soon dominated the architectural avant-garde in the \u201860s and early \u201870s. The print run of their Archigram magazine soon mushroomed from a few hundred to several thousand.\nRon Herron's \"Seaside Bubbles\" (1966):Photo: \nImage: Design Museum\nThe group\u2019s main concern was to see the radical changes of the \u201860s reflected in contemporary architecture. These changes included John F. Kennedy influencing world politics; Michel Foucault and Claude L?vi-Strauss influencing intellectual ideas; the Beatles, Bob Dylon, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg shaping the arts; and the public getting the photocopier and the contraceptive pill. David Green wrote in Archigram magazine\u2019s first issue:\n\nFor Archigram, mobility was important and omnipresent, even for the urban landscape that became a \u201cWalking City\u201d. Buildings can form new clusters anywhere to deal with the changing demands of a city. Yesterday\u2019s offices could change into tomorrow\u2019s museums and kindergardens. \nRather than dwell on urban destruction, with projects such as \"Living City,\" \"Plug-in City,\" \"Walking City\" and \"Blow-out Village,\" Archigram propagated an optimistic and fun approach to nomadic architecture that was supposed to set people free. How workable their architectural designs were in practice is debatable, but they sure inspired quite a few fellow architects; Will Alsop\u2019s Peckham Library in south London and Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano\u2019s Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris are among the most well-known. \nFor those who can't get enough, here\u2019s Herron\u2019s \"Walking City\" of 1964 in more detail:\nSource: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
