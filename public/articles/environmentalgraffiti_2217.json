The fungus is blamed for driving more than a third of all amphibian populations towards extinction. At least 130 species are more than likely already extinct because of the disease.\nAfter two weeks of treatment with the antibiotic chloramphenicol, however, the frogs were cured. \"Our results are 100 percent certain,\" said zoologist Paul Bishop of the University of Otago in New Zealand. He said chloramphenicol was \"definitely the best\" treatment so far discovered.\nWhile scientists are rejoicing over the discovery of a cure, some scientists are more sober. They point out that the declines associated with the disease will still occur, as all the frogs in the world cannot be rounded up and treated for two weeks with antibiotics. They do concede, however, that it is a positive step towards preventing extinction in affected populations.\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"science","title":"Pinkeye Medicine Prevents Frog Apocalypse","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/influenza-virusjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/pinkeye-medicine-prevents-frog-apocalypse/420"}
