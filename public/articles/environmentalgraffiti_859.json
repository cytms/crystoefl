On top of that of course is climate change, which is progressively removing the sea ice that the bears thrive on.\nThe WWF report highlights that Canada is about to sell off  a bear habitat on June 2nd to the oil company who supplies the highest bid; an imperative is laid at the state to issue guidelines for protecting the bears and their habitat even as the exploration goes on.  Without it, they claim, the bears have exhibited a willingness to walk all the way to Russia, or travel hundreds of miles inland in search of safe habitats and food.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
