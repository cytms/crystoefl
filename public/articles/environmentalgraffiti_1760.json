True, there have been a number of vehicles released that run on electricity but now designers are turning to another precious resource \u2013 air.\nIt's not a new concept, as early as the 1920s, car designers were dabbling with the idea of cars that could run off air alone \u2013 one involved cycling air through a propeller at the front of the car \u2013 but few came to fruition. Now, designers are again looking at how air can be used to power a car. \nPhoto: Image: Magnetic Air Cars, Inc.\nMagnetic Air Cars, Inc, a company based in San Jose, California, recently revealed their sleek new design for the world\u2019s first fuel-less car at the eco convention, West Coast Green. As the name suggests, the \u2018Magnetic Air Car\u2019 will be powered through magnetic technology and compressed air. When air is channeled through the engine, the resultant airflow is converted to torque, which in turn powers the axis and propels the car. This process is powered by a silicon energy storage battery, which can be charged in an hour and has a 10-year lifespan and is 95% recyclable, making this new-age creation possibly one of the most sustainable cars on the planet.\nExecutives from the company have announced they\u2019re planning to build a working prototype soon and could have it ready for full production as early as 2010.
