Along for the seasonal trek will be some species of butterflies and moths. While you can probably tell a bird apart from a bat quite easily if they are not too far away, you might have a harder time telling a butterfly apart from a moth even up close. Next time you see one of them, check for the following characteristics.\nPhoto: Shyamal\nExcept for one group of tropical butterflies, all butterflies have simple antennae that end in a swelling that looks like a knob or club. The clubs are very pronounced in certain species. Moth antennae do not have this structure, although their antennae range in shape and texture.\nPhoto: Jillski\nBody - Thorax\nButterflies have bright colors and slender bodies that are not fuzzy. Moths have hairy bodies (pubescent) that are not usually colorful. They have cryptic wing patterns.\nPhoto: Dr. F. Nemos\nA butterfly has an enlarged humeral lobe on each hindwing, while a moth has a frenulum, which is a structure consisting of bristles or spines.\nButterflies do not have tiny hooks or bristles, which link forewing to hindwing in moths. A butterfly rests with wings closed, while a moth usually rests with its wings open.\nPhoto: Saleem Hameed\nDaytime Activity\nButterflies are active during the day (diurnal). Moths are active at dawn or dusk (crepuscular).\nPhoto: meganmccarty\nDevelopment\nCocoons and chrysalids protect the pupa, which is the intermediate stage between the larva and adult. While a moth makes a cocoon wrapped in a silk covering, a butterfly makes a chrysalis, which is hard and smooth without a silk covering.\nButterfly pupae hang above ground from a branch or similar support. A moth pupae is found underground or on the ground.\nThere aren\u2019t any simple characteristics to differentiate between butterfly caterpillars and pupae from those of moths according to Big Sky Institute at Montana State University.\nPhoto: Hustvedt\nReferences: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Opler, Paul A., Kelly Lotts, and Thomas Naberhaus, coordinators. 2010.
