After presenting her idea to the U.S. Army superintendent in charge of the park, however, she was promptly turned down. For the next 24 years, the sting of rejection from a series of officials became a familiar feeling. \u201cAmiable Army officers lent weary ear to the tale of the Japanese cherry blossom and the future fairyland, but none grew excited or was convinced,\u201d she lamented in a 1910 magazine article.\nIn 1908 Scidmore attended an Arbor Day talk by David Fairchild and discovered a kindred spirit. A doctor and U.S. Department of Agriculture official, Fairchild had successfully transplanted 100 Japanese cherry trees on his Chevy Chase, Maryland, estate and envisioned a \u201cfield of cherries\u201d around the Potomac River and the newly constructed Tidal Basin.\nWhen the cherry trees arrived in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 1910, they were unfortunately bearing more than just goodwill. The Department of Agriculture discovered the trees were infested with insects and parasitic worms. On January 28, 1910, President William Taft regretfully gave his assent to destroy the trees, and most were incinerated in heaps resembling giant funeral pyres. \nUndeterred, Takamine proposed an even larger donation. When the second shipment of 3,020 cherry trees, composed of a dozen varieties gifted by Tokyo, reached the capital in March 1912, they were in perfect condition. On March 27, 1912, in a simple ceremony with little fanfare and no photographers, the first lady and the Japanese ambassador\u2019s wife dug their spades into the ground to begin planting the first two trees, which still stand today along the northwest wall of the Tidal Basin. Scidmore was also in attendance.\nPlanting continued for the rest of the decade, and the flowering trees quickly became such a beloved Washington institution that the selection of the Tidal Basin as the location for the new Jefferson Memorial led to howls of public protests from those fearing the mass removal of the trees. Flamboyant newspaper editor Eleanor \u201cCissy\u201d Patterson, who took daily walks with her poodles under the canopy of the cherry trees, led the grassroots opposition, pledging in the Washington Herald to \u201cdefy workmen to so much as break a twig.\u201d \nOn November 18, 1938, a band of 150 society ladies in furs descended upon the Jefferson Memorial\u2019s construction site. To the astonishment of Civilian Conservation Corps engineers and gardeners, some of the women chained themselves to cherry trees, while others grabbed shovels out of the workers\u2019 hands and began to replace the dirt that had been removed from around the trees. \u201cThis is the worst desecration of beauty in the capital since the burning of the White House by the British,\u201d stated one protestor chained to a tree.\nA few blocks away at the White House, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was drawn to the ruckus later dubbed the \u201cCherry Tree Rebellion.\u201d The president declared that the trees were going be transplanted, not cut down, and that reports of proposed tree destructions were \u201cone of the most interesting cases of newspaper flimflam\u201d he had ever encountered. Roosevelt joked that if the protestors didn\u2019t leave, \u201cthe cherry trees, the women and their chains would be gently but firmly transplanted in some other part of Potomac Park.\u201d That night, once the protestors left, cherry trees were uprooted under the cover of darkness to avoid further disturbances.\nJust three years later, however, Americans weren\u2019t quite as enamored of the cherry trees. On the night of December 10, 1941, three days after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, four trees were chopped down during a temporary blackout in what was suspected to be a misguided act of retaliation by an unknown offender. For the duration of World War II, the gifts from Japan would be referred to as \u201cOriental\u201d (not \u201cJapanese\u201d) cherry trees. \nIn 1999, more than half a century later, the cherry trees were again attacked, but this time the culprits were identified. Gnawing beavers had felled four trees with their mighty incisors and damaged several others. The animals were relocated from the Tidal Basin, and physical barriers were installed around some of the trees. \nThe Japanese cherry blossoms have endured for a century in the nation\u2019s capital, and there are now more than 3,750 trees. In 1991 a few young plants grafted from the trees were gifted back to Japan, and one of them graces the front of a tombstone in a crowded Yokohama cemetery. An adjacent monument reads: \u201cA woman who loved Japanese cherry blossoms rests in peace here.\u201d That woman is Eliza Scidmore.","author":"Christopher  Klein","web_category":"news","title":"The Drama Behind 100 Years of Washington\u2019s Cherry Blossoms","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cherry-blossom-festival.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/the-drama-behind-100-years-of-washingtons-cherry-blossoms"}
