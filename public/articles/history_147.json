Twelve days before, the Air Force major had flown one of the first top-secret reconnaissance missions over Cuba that confirmed the existence of Soviet missile sites just 90 miles from the American mainland. Anderson was not originally scheduled to fly on this day, but he lobbied hard for the assignment when the mission was added to the schedule. Mission 3127, Anderson\u2019s sixth foray over Cuba as part of \u201cOperation Brass Knob,\u201d would be his most dangerous yet, with Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) now operational and war seemingly imminent.\nShortly after Anderson entered Cuban air space, his unarmed, high-altitude U-2 spy plane appeared as a blip on Soviet radar. As the Soviet military tracked the intruding aircraft, their concern mounted that the pilot was photographing secret locations of tactical nuclear weapons positioned near America\u2019s Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. \u201cOur guest has been up there for over an hour,\u201d Lieutenant General Stepan Grechko told a deputy. \u201cI think we should give the order to shoot it down, as it is discovering our positions in depth.\u201d With the commanding general, the only man authorized to order a surface-to-air missile launch, nowhere to be found, Grechko gave the order himself: \u201cDestroy Target Number 33.\u201d\nTwo surface-to-air missiles rocketed into the sky near the eastern port city of Banes. One exploded near the U-2. Shrapnel pierced the cockpit along with Anderson\u2019s pressurized flight suit and helmet, likely killing him instantly. The U-2 plunged 72,000 feet to the tropical island below. Target number 33 was destroyed.\nWithin hours, word of the shootdown reached the White House Cabinet Room, which all day long had crackled with tension amid news that the Soviet nuclear missile sites were nearly operational and that another U-2 plane had accidentally flown over the Soviet Union, sending Soviet MiG fighters scrambling in pursuit. Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Nitze said, \u201cThey\u2019ve fired the first shot,\u201d and President John F. Kennedy remarked, \u201cWe are now in an entirely new ball game.\u201d Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy would later write in \u201cThirteen Days,\u201d his memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis, \u201cThere was the feeling that the noose was tightening on all of us, on Americans, on mankind, and that the bridges to escape were crumbling.\u201d\nMilitary leaders overwhelmingly urged Kennedy to launch airstrikes against Cuba\u2019s air defenses the following morning. The president, however, correctly suspected that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had not authorized the downings of unarmed reconnaissance planes, and he didn\u2019t want to abandon diplomacy just yet.\nFor Kennedy and Khrushchev, Anderson\u2019s death crystallized their realization that the crisis was rapidly spiraling out of their control. \u201cIt was at that very moment\u2014not before or after\u2014that father felt the situation was slipping out of his control,\u201d Khrushchev\u2019s son Sergei would later write. Kennedy worried that retaliatory airstrikes would inevitably result in all-out war. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the first step that concerns me, but both sides escalating to the fourth or fifth step and we don\u2019t go to the sixth because there is no one around to do so,\u201d he told his advisers.\nThat night, the president dispatched his brother to meet with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin and offer a top-secret deal to peacefully end the standoff. The Soviets agreed to remove their nuclear missiles from Cuba, while the Americans pledged to withdraw intermediate nuclear missiles from Turkey and not invade Cuba. The tensest moments of the Cuban Missile Crisis had ended, with Major Anderson the only combat casualty in a standoff that had the real possibility of killing millions.\nWhen Kennedy learned that the 35-year-old Anderson had a wife and two sons, 5 and 3 years old, it struck home. \u201cHe had a boy about the same age as John,\u201d he told his advisers. \u201cYour husband\u2019s mission was of the greatest importance, but I know how deeply you must feel his loss,\u201d Kennedy wrote in a letter to Anderson\u2019s widow, two months pregnant with a baby girl. Anderson posthumously became the first-ever recipient of the Air Force Cross, the service\u2019s highest designation short of the Medal of Honor.\nMemories of Rudolf Anderson may have faded, but he\u2019s not forgotten in his hometown of Greenville, South Carolina, where he built model airplanes as a young boy and chose \u201cGood humor is the clear blue sky of the soul\u201d as his high school yearbook quote. On the 50th anniversary of his death, the city of Greenville\u2014in conjunction with Furman University and the Upcountry History Museum\u2014will unveil the redesigned Major Rudolf Anderson Jr. Memorial, which was originally installed in 1963. Thirteen engraved granite slabs embedded in the lawn describe each day of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and surrounding an F-86 Sabre Jet, similar to one flown by Anderson, are text panels describing his boyhood, his distinguished military career and his lasting legacy of contributing to the peaceful resolution of the crisis.\n\u201cAnderson\u2019s death escalated the crisis significantly,\u201d said Upcountry History Museum historian Courtney Tollison. \u201cIt could have provoked a cascading series of events that if you follow to their logical conclusions lead to a nuclear World War III. Instead, his death was a jolt to Kennedy and Khrushchev and pushed the crisis to a point where they had to take one of two paths, both of which had clear consequences.\u201d","author":"Christopher  Klein","web_category":"news","title":"The Cuban Missile Crisis Pilot Whose Death May Have Saved Millions","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/rudolf-anderson-portrait.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/the-cuban-missile-crisis-pilot-whose-death-may-have-saved-millions"}
