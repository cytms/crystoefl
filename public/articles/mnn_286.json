The space rock will come within 3.6 million miles (5.8 million km) of our planet \u2014 about 15 times the distance separating Earth and the moon, researchers say.\n?\nBut the close approach will still be dramatic for astronomers, who plan to get a good look at 1998 QE2 using two huge radar telescopes \u2014 NASA's 230-foot (70 meters) Goldstone dish in California and the 1,000-foot (305 m) Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.

It's just the moniker assigned by the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Mass., which names each newfound asteroid according to an established alphanumeric scheme that lays out when it was discovered.\n?\nAstronomers plan to study 1998 QE2 intensively from May 30 through June 9, using the Goldstone and Arecibo dishes to learn as much as possible about the asteroid before it slips off once more into the depths of space.\n?\nEven from about 4 million miles (6.4 million km) away, Goldstone images may be able to resolve features on 1998 QE2 as small as 12 feet (3.75 m) across, researchers said.\n?\n\"It is tremendously exciting to see detailed images of this asteroid for the first time,\" Benner said. \"With radar we can transform an object from a point of light into a small world with its own unique set of characteristics. In a real sense, radar imaging of near-Earth asteroids is a fundamental form of exploring a whole class of solar system objects.\"\n?\nNASA leads the global effort to identify potentially dangerous asteroids. Our planet has been pummeled by space rocks throughout its 4.5-billion-year history, and more strikes are in our future.\n?\nThe planet got a dramatic reminder of this reality this past Feb. 15. On that day, a 55-foot (17 m) object exploded without warning over Russia, just hours before the 130-foot asteroid 2012 DA14 gave Earth a close shave, missing our planet by just 17,200 miles (27,000 km).\n?\nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter?@michaeldwall?and?Google+.?Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebookor Google+.
