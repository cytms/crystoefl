(In another version of this story, wolves engineered their own domestication after tasting the bounty of campsite living.) But where exactly did dogs first diverge from their ancestors, undergoing the subtle genetic changes that made them social, submissive and, of course, snuggly?\nThe answer, according to Swedish and Chinese researchers, lies on the southern banks of the Yangtze River, in a small area of East Asia known as the ASY region. \u201cOur results confirm that Asia south of the Yangtze River was the most important\u2014and probably the only\u2014region for wolf domestication, and that a large number of wolves were domesticated,\u201d said Peter Savolainen of Sweden\u2019s KTH Royal Institute of Technology, co-author of a paper summarizing the findings that was published last week in the journal Heredity.\nSavolainen and his colleagues reached these conclusions after analyzing DNA from 151 male dogs born in various places around the world. They determined that the ASY region is the only spot on the planet with the entire range of genetic diversity found in modern dogs. \u201cThis shows that gene pools in all other regions of the world most probably originate from the ASY region,\u201d Savolainen explained. Crossbreeding between dogs and wolves from other areas \u201ccontributed only modestly to the dog gene pool,\u201d he said.\nThe new paper conflicts with research on canine genetics led by biologists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and published last March in Nature. It made the case that the domestication of wolves first occurred in the Middle East about 10,000 years ago. However, that study and others with similar findings failed to include samples from the ASY region in their analysis, according to Savolainen.\nNo matter how strong the genetic support for dogs\u2019 south-of-the-Yangtze roots, archaeological evidence remains sketchy. The Heredity study\u2019s authors point out that excavations have unearthed remains of domestic dogs from 11,500 years ago in southwest Asia and from 10,000 years ago in Europe, but only from 6,500 years ago in the ASY region. They speculate that \u201cgeographical bias\u201d in the archaeological record could account for the discrepancy, and that future digs in the area might corroborate the revised narrative.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Is East Asia the Kennel of Dog Civilization?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/dog-origins-inline.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/is-east-asia-the-kennel-of-dog-civilization"}
