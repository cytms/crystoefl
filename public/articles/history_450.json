Proposed sitters for the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d have included da Vinci\u2019s mother Caterina, Princess Isabella of Naples, a Spanish noblewoman named Costanza d\u2019Avalos and Cecilia Gallerani, who posed for an earlier painting, \u201cThe Lady With an Ermine.\u201d Some of the more provocative theories emphasize the subject\u2019s masculine facial features, suggesting that da Vinci based the portrait on his own likeness or that of his longtime apprentice and possible lover, Gian Giacomo Caprotti, known as Salai, who inherited the work after his mentor\u2019s death. (In February 2011, the art historian Silvano Vinceti, who is leading the current dig, intriguingly pointed out that the title \u201cMona Lisa\u201d could be interpreted as an anagram for \u201cMon [French for \u2018my\u2019] Salai.\u201d)\nIn 2008, researchers at Heidelberg University announced they had cracked the puzzle of Mona Lisa\u2019s identity after finding a handwritten note in the margin of a 500-year-old manuscript, penned by a Florentine clerk who admired da Vinci. The note, dated October 1503, states that the artist was working on a portrait of Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, a wealthy silk merchant\u2019s wife whom art historians have long considered the leading candidate for the famous painting\u2019s model. When da Vinci bequeathed the portrait to Salai, he referred to it as \u201cLa Gioconda,\u201d the Italian word for playful, which may also have been a pun on the feminine form of Gherardini\u2019s married name.\nOne year before the note\u2019s discovery, an amateur historian tracked down a death certificate for Gherardini\u2014who became a nun during her widowhood\u2014showing she had died at 65 on July 15, 1542, and was buried in Florence\u2019s Saint Ursula convent. The site, which dates back to 1309, was converted into a tobacco factory in the 19th century and sheltered World War II refugees during the 1940s and 1950s. Saint Ursula later fell into disrepair and remained empty until recent weeks, when archaeologists used ground-penetrating radar machines to search for graves under the three-story complex\u2019s concrete floor. They broke ground on May 9, uncovering a layer of ancient bricks and what they believe to be steps leading to Gherardini\u2019s tomb.\nOnce they unseal the crypt, the team hopes to hand over skull bones to the paleoanthropologist Francesco Mallegni, who will use them to reconstruct Gherardini\u2019s face and try to discern the haunting features of the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d The researchers will also attempt to verify Gherardini\u2019s identity by comparing the remains\u2019 genetic material to DNA from her children, who are known to be buried at Florence\u2019s Santissima Annunziata church.\nWhile this exercise may help determine just whose eyes millions of observers have been staring into for five centuries, it did not immediately sit well with Gherardini\u2019s descendants. In late April, Natalia Guicciardini Strozzi, a member of one of Florence\u2019s oldest noble families, told the The Telegraph that the excavation was \u201ca sacrilegious act.\u201d After visiting the site and meeting with Silvano Vinceti and his team, however, she shed some of her earlier reservations, saying, \u201cAt first the thought of the dig horrified me but now I am fascinated.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Archaeologists Bring Mona Lisa\u2019s Top Model to Light","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mona-lisa.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/archaeologists-bring-mona-lisas-top-model-to-light"}
