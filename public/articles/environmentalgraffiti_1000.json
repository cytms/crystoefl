Recently released photographs were published in several major news outlets showing two horses engaged in a \u201chorse fight\u201d for spectators\u2019 and gamblers\u2019 amusement.\nThe photographs were taken at a festival in Guizhou, China, and show two horses brutally fighting each other as a large and rapt crowd looks on.\nHorse fighting has been practiced in China for over half a millennium. It is also popular in other Asian countries, including the Philippines, South Korea, and Indonesia.

Karen Chisholm of PETA said: \u201cTorturing these magnificent animals in the name of entertainment is deplorable.

The group said that fake fur\u2019s petrochemical basis was bad for the environment, while fur was a biodegradable and renewable resource.\nAnimal rights groups are dead set against the campaign.\nPETA spokesperson Mike Rice said: \"It's completely ridiculous.
