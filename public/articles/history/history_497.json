Because the Mercury spacecraft afforded little room, candidates had to be less than 6 feet and weigh no more than 180 pounds. Other requirements included 1,500 hours of flying time and an age under 40. After several month of physical and mental testing, NASA narrowed the group down to seven astronauts, including Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom and John Glenn.

A chimpanzee named Ham went on a suborbital mission on January 31, 1961, in a spacecraft similar to that piloted by Alan Shepard during his historic flight more than two months later. After 16 minutes in space, Ham splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, suffering only a bruised nose. He lived out the rest of his years at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and at the North Carolina Zoo.

Unlike Gagarin’s mission, Mercury-Redstone 3 followed a ballistic trajectory and did not complete an orbit of the Earth. John Glenn would become the first American to accomplish that feat in February 1962, traveling around the Earth three times on the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission.

Grissom survived but the spacecraft was lost at sea. Assigned as command pilot for the first Apollo mission, Grissom died tragically on January 27, 1967, when a fire during a pre-launch test claimed the lives of all three Apollo 1 astronauts.
