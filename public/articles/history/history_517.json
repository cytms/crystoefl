Commanded by veteran astronaut John Young, the only person who has piloted four different classes of spacecraft, Columbia orbited the Earth 37 times over a 54.5-hour period. The shuttle’s maiden voyage occurred 20 years to the day after the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to enter outer space on April 12, 1961. Despite some problems, STS-1 was deemed a success, and Columbia went on to fly the next four shuttle missions.

The primary aim of the mission was to deploy the first satellite of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) network, which NASA uses to communicate with spacecraft and for a variety of other purposes. The STS-6 mission was also remarkable because it was the first time astronauts used newly designed space suits known as Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) to perform tasks outside the spacecraft, such as spacewalks.

The disaster claimed the lives of all seven astronauts aboard, including Christa McAuliffe, a teacher from New Hampshire who had been selected to join the mission and teach lessons from space to schoolchildren around the country. It was later determined that two rubber O-rings, which had been designed to separate the sections of the rocket booster, had failed due to cold temperatures on the morning of the launch. The tragedy and its aftermath received extensive media coverage and prompted NASA to temporarily suspend all shuttle missions.

Eighty seconds into its launch on January 16, a piece of foam insulation had detached from the shuttle's propellant tank and hit the edge of the shuttle's left wing, but neither NASA nor the crew realized the extent of the damage. Upon reentry, because the heat-resistant tiles covering the left wing's leading edge had been broken or were missing, wind and heat entered the wing and blew it apart. In August 2003, an investigation board issued a report that revealed that it in fact would have been possible either for the Columbia crew to repair the damage to the wing or for the crew to be rescued from the shuttle.
