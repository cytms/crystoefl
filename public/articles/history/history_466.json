He insisted that they all receive a thorough education, including the girls. When one of his sons, known as Pepin the Hunchback, was found guilty of participating in a plot to kill Charlemagne, it was expected that he would be executed along with his co-conspirators. Instead, the emperor took pity on Pepin, ordered his sentence commuted and sent him to a monastery.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCzar Nicholas II\r\n                    \r\n \t\t\t\t\thttp://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nicholas-ii.jpg\r\n                    \r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe last Russian emperor, Nicholas had five children with his wife, the German-born Alix of Hesse. A loving father, Nicholas was especially concerned with the health of his only son and heir, Alexei, who suffered from hemophilia.

Though he doted on all his children, Twain was particularly close with his oldest, Susy, who shared his love of acting and writing. He based at least two major characters in his novels on her. When she died of meningitis as a young woman in 1896, Twain fell into a deep depression. Later, he included passages written by Susy about her father in his autobiography.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBust of Cicero\r\n                    \r\n \t\t\t\t\thttp://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/cicero-bust.jpg\r\n                    \r\n\t\t\t\t\tA prominent ancient Roman statesman and philosopher, Cicero adored his daughter Tullia and was devastated when she died of complications from childbirth in 45 B.C. Inconsolable despite his friends’ many letters of condolence, some of which are still in existence, Cicero isolated himself for several weeks at the home of his friend Atticus, where he read texts by Greek philosophers about how to overcome grief.

He may have had a hand in the romantic involvement of both his daughters with Henry, who first had an affair with Mary Boleyn and later pursued her older sister, Anne. As Henry’s obsession with Anne grew, so did Thomas’ standing in court, and some have speculated that he pressured his daughter to insist on wedding the king, who was already married at the time. Three years after the controversial marriage, Anne, having failed to produce a male heir, fell out of favor and was beheaded for high treason; her brother George suffered the same fate. Thomas, meanwhile, had done nothing to protect his two children despite his influence and the fact that they were almost certainly innocent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIvan the Terrible After Fatally Wounding His Son\r\n                    \r\n \t\t\t\t\thttp://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ivan-the-terrible.jpg\r\n                    \r\n\t\t\t\t\tA successful czar who expanded the borders of his realm but was probably plagued by mental illness, Ivan ruled Russia from 1533 until his death in 1584. It is likely that his nine children suffered years of abuse at his hands. In 1581 he beat his pregnant daughter-in-law as punishment for wearing revealing clothing, causing her to miscarry. Her husband, also named Ivan, angrily confronted his father, who had banished his son’s first two wives to convents after pronouncing them infertile. Incensed, the czar struck his heir on the head with his scepter. The younger Ivan died a few days later as his remorseful father prayed by his bedside for a miracle.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHerod the Great During the Capture of Jerusalem\r\n                    \r\n \t\t\t\t\thttp://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/herod-the-great.jpg\r\n                    \r\n\t\t\t\t\tKing of Judea from 37 to 4 B.C., Herod is remembered as an ambitious but cruel and paranoid ruler who infamously ordered the executions of several members of his own family.
