It describes the mad rush for the elevators, the collapse of the building’s sole fire escape and the horrific sight of some 50 women leaping to their deaths. In a statement excerpted in the article, Fire Chief Edward Croker blames the high casualty count on insufficient fire escapes and stairways, a lack of sprinklers and the fact that doors had been sealed shut. “This calamity is just what I have been predicting,” he says. “I have been advocating and agitating that fire escapes be put on buildings just such as this. This large loss of life is due to this neglect.” Meanwhile, an official who refused to be named makes the heartbreaking revelation that the building containing the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory was one of 7,000 that had been recommended for additional fire escapes following a Fire Department investigation just weeks earlier. Tragically missing from the article is eyewitness testimony from the factory’s cutting room, where the fire had apparently broke out around 4:40 p.m.: “No living person has so far been found who was in the cutting room of the Triangle Waist Company, on the eight floor, to tell of the horror of those first few seconds after the alarm was sounded. The terror of the hundreds of helpless girls on that floor can only be imagined.”Credit: Library of Congress.

(The death toll is now estimated at 145.) In some instances, the reporter explains, identification could only be made based on the pay envelopes workers carried in their pockets and stockings. The scene is then compared to the aftermath of the 1904 General Slocum steamship tragedy, New York’s worst disaster in terms of loss of life at that time, in which an estimated 1,021 people perished.Credit: Library of Congress.

According to the story, Blanck, his two young daughters and his business partner, Isaac Harris, crossed the eight feet from the roof to an adjoining building on the shoulders of a half dozen men who formed a human chain. “Not a person was as much as scratched in the process,” the article reports. Blanck and Harris, known as the “shirtwaist kings” because they operated the largest firm in the business, would later be indicted on seven counts of manslaughter after witnesses testified that they locked the doors to the factory’s stairwells and exits, ostensibly to prevent theft. They were acquitted of all charges and ultimately collected a substantial chunk of insurance money equivalent to $400 per victim.Credit: Library of Congress.

It also hints at the wave of labor and building reforms that the Triangle Shirtwaist tragedy would eventually trigger, particularly in New York City: “The fact that there was only one fire escape on the building will be rigidly investigated…. Fire insurance men are inclined to urge a complete revision of New York laws limiting the height of all buildings and even the tearing down of existing skyscrapers is recommended. Four or five stories should be the legal maximum where manufacturing or industrial pursuits are followed.”Credit: University of North Texas.

It reports the arrest of seven Los Angeles property owners “for alleged flagrant violations of the city ordinance providing for the equipment of buildings of various classes with proper apparatus for fire protection.” Los Angeles’ fire chief is quoted as saying, “There are many frame apartment houses, particularly in the hilly districts, that—well, God help us if they ever catch fire.” The same column provides an update on the situation in New York, explaining that a “great labor demonstration” is planned in conjunction with the victims’ burial.Credit: University of Oregon.

It also reports that an inquiry by New York City’s fire marshal determined that the fire’s victims “found traps at every turn” as they struggled to flee the blaze.Credit: University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries.

The jury, which deliberated for fewer than two hours, cited the prosecutor’s failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the pair had known about the locked doors when the blaze broke out.Credit: University of North Texas.

Convicted of locking the exits of his new facility, Blanck had the option of spending five days in the penitentiary or coughing up $20. The article describes his reaction: “He smiled, pulled out a ‘roll’ of money as thick as his arm, peeled off a $20 bill and walked off.”Credit: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library.

The paltry sum they collected—$75, equivalent to roughly $1,600 today—was paid not by the company’s owners but by an employers’ liability company.Credit: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library.
