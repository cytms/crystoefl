He composed many of the group’s chart-topping hits, including “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Killer Queen.” Diagnosed with AIDS in 1987, Mercury continued performing with his characteristically electrifying stage presence despite his declining health. He disclosed his condition a day before dying on September 5, 1991, saying, “I hope that everyone will join with me, my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease.” In the years that followed, the remaining members of Queen and other musicians raised millions for AIDS research in Mercury’s memory, organizing tribute concerts and establishing charities.

His Magic Johnson Foundation has funded research, testing programs and awareness campaigns for the last two decades. Johnson, who manages his condition with antiretroviral drugs, has also served as an inspiration for those living with HIV and AIDS.

He contracted HIV while undergoing heart surgery in 1983 and announced he had AIDS in 1992. Ashe spent the last year of his life raising awareness about AIDS and its victims around the world, imploring the United Nations to address the epidemic as a global issue. He founded the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, which continues its outreach programs to this day. Ashe died of AIDS-related pneumonia on February 6, 1993.

He spent his final years writing songs about his struggle with AIDS and speaking about prevention at a time when the growing epidemic was a taboo subject.
