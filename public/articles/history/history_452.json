They carried with them a small metal marker used to label merchandise heading across the Atlantic from England to the fledgling colony. Unearthed at the Jamestown site in 2006, the cargo tag is inscribed with the name of its destination: “Yames Towne.” The mission’s payload also included commemorative coins honoring American explorers.

Her wreck was discovered in 1971 and salvaged in 1982. Michael Foale, one of the volunteer divers who helped excavate the Mary Rose, went on to become an astronaut for NASA. Thanks in part to this connection, the Mary Rose Museum loaned a small wooden ball—part of the mechanism that once raised the historic ship’s sails—to the crew of Discovery’s last mission. After more than 400 years underwater, the Mary Rose took flight in February 2011.

His discovery proved the existence of other galaxies and revealed that the universe was even larger than previously thought. It seemed only fitting to honor his contributions during the 1990 Discovery mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. At first his trademark pipe was considered for the voyage, but ultimately copies of the first photographic glass plate Hubble made of V1 accompanied his namesake telescope into space.
