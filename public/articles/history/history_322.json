Although British sovereigns no longer wielded significant political power by the time she ascended the thrown, she managed to influence government policy and helped shape the culture of the era that would bear her name. All of Victoria’s nine children and many of her grandchildren married into other powerful royal or noble families, earning her the nickname “the grandmother of Europe.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth II (60 years)\r\n                    \r\n \t\t\t\t\thttp://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/elizabeth-ii.jpg\r\n                    \r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 1937, 10-year-old Elizabeth became the heiress presumptive after her father, King George VI, ascended the throne following his older brother’s controversial abdication.

As the first British royal family of the television age, Elizabeth, her husband Prince Philip and their children and grandchildren have often been thrust into the public spotlight.

His reign was marked by a number of military conflicts in various parts of the world, including the American Revolutionary War, in which Britain lost its American colonies. In popular culture, he is often remembered for his intermittent bouts of mental illness and the dementia he suffered during his final years in power. The father of 15 children, he was succeeded by his son George IV.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJames VI & I (57 years, eight months, three days)\r\n                    \r\n \t\t\t\t\thttp://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/james-vi-i.jpg\r\n                    \r\n\t\t\t\t\tBorn in 1566, James became king of Scotland at just 13 months old.
