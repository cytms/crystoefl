(Credit: Brian Choo)Paleontologists unearthed three specimens of the new dinosaur, known as Yutyrannus huali (“beautiful feathered tyrant”), in China’s Liaoning Province. It lived roughly 125 million years ago, 60 million years before the more advanced tyrannosauroid T. rex. While Yutyrannus shares some features with its famous cousin, it still has the three-fingered forelimbs and primitive theropod foot of other early tyrannosauroids.Skull of Yutyrannus huali.

Corwin Sullivan, a Canadian paleontologist involved in the Nature study, said the enigmatic dinosaur might have relied on its quills for insulation. “However,” he added, “large-bodied animals typically can retain heat quite easily, and actually have more of a potential problem with overheating. That makes Yutyrannus, which is large and downright shaggy, a bit of a surprise.”","web_category":"news","advice_category":"1","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/themes/commons/imgs/template/history-logo.png","title":"T.
