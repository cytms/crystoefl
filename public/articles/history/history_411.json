One day in 2008, his 9-year-old son Matthew stumbled across the ancient remains of a juvenile male with a distinctive combination of primitive and human-like features. Berger’s team later found the skeleton of an adult female and other individuals with similar traits nearby; they may have died after falling into a deep cave. New research suggests the fossils, which are thought to belong to a newly discovered species dubbed Australopithecus sediba, are roughly 1.98 million years old.

They discovered that Australopithecus sediba’s brain was smaller than that of Australopithecus afarensis, which lived a million years earlier, and was closer in size to a chimpanzee’s than a human’s.

This challenges the prevailing view that brain size increased gradually during the transition from Australopithecus to Homo; instead, neural reorganization that paved the way for human-like thinking may have happened before brains enlarged.

Researchers detected a mixture of ape-like grasping muscles, which indicate Australopithecus sediba spent a lot of time climbing trees, and human-like features used for precise gripping and dexterity. Australopithecus sediba may have been capable of fashioning and using simple tools—and was possibly better at it than the later Homo habilis, the scientists found.
