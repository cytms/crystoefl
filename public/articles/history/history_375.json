At the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology’s annual meeting on November 2, 2011 in Las Vegas, doctoral student Scott Persons of the University of Alberta presented new findings about the oviraptor’s tail and how it might have been used. The dense arrangement of the bones in the tail was unusual even among theropods (which are the group of dinosaurs most closely related to modern-day birds) and allowed it to move with greater flexibility.Oviraptor tails were also extremely muscular, and, according to fossil impressions, had a fan of feathers at the end. In Persons’ view, oviraptors could very well have used their muscular, flexible tails to wave their feathers in order to impress potential mates, just as peacocks use their magnificent jewel-toned feathers in courtship displays today.","web_category":"news","advice_category":"1","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/themes/commons/imgs/template/history-logo.png","title":"Flirting With Dinosaurs","author":"Sarah  Pruitt"}
