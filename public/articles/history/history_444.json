This technique dates back at least to ancient Egypt, where people would hang wet mats over their doorways and slaves would fan clay jars filled with water. Similarly, Native Americans dug water trenches beneath their huts, while settlers in the American West kept cool during hot nights by hanging wet sheets on their sleeping porches. In 19th-century New England, evaporative cooling was used to temper the blazing heat inside textile mills. Some modern air conditioning systems, often known as swamp coolers, still rely on this ancient method.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSnow and Ice\r\n                    \r\n \t\t\t\t\thttp://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/snow-and-ice.jpg\r\n                    \r\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to legend, several heat-averse Roman emperors, including the notoriously lavish Elagabulus, had snow hauled down from mountaintops to cool their summer villas and chill their drinks.

In the 16th century they became extremely popular as fashion accessories among European women, including Queen Elizabeth I, who appears with a hand fan in many portraits. During their heyday, fans were imported by the boatloads from China and churned out by specialized artisans in France.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPassive Solar Design\r\n                    \r\n \t\t\t\t\thttp://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/passive-solar-design.jpg\r\n                    \r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn many early civilizations, architects developed techniques for retaining heat from sunlight during the winter and maximizing shade during the summer. Today, this is known as passive solar design. Cliff dwellings built by the Anasazi people, located in southwestern Colorado’s Mesa Verde National Park, offer a particularly striking example. Tucked under south-facing rock overhangs, their homes soaked up the sun in cold months and were cloaked in shade when summer arrived.

Though many were later replaced by more permanent homes, these shelters had the advantage of being easy to heat during harsh winters and staying cool during sizzling summers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t  la                                \r\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n            \t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t            \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tjQuery.noConflict();\r\n\ttid('sgpro_slideshow').style.display = \"none\";\r\n\ttid('slideshow-wrapper').style.display = 'block';\r\n\ttid('slideshow-wrapper').style.visibility = 'hidden';\t\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * issue #2: Bugfix for WebKit.
