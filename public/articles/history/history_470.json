{"url":"http://www.history.com/news/pentagon-papers-fully-declassified-on-famous-leaks-40th-anniversary","content":"Forty years ago today, the most famous leak in American history came to light when The New York Times began publishing sections of the so-called Pentagon Papers, a top-secret Department of Defense report on America’s involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967. Commissioned by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the 47-volume study indicated that the U.S. government had misled the public and Congress, deceiving them about the scope, goals and progress of the increasingly unpopular war. The Times had obtained the incriminating papers from Daniel Ellsberg, a former Defense Department analyst turned antiwar activist who had smuggled them out of the Pentagon.The Pentagon Papers’ publication sparked a nationwide furor, galvanizing the powerful antiwar movement and damaging the credibility of America’s Cold War-era foreign policy. It also precipitated a decisive ideological and legal battle over the freedom of the press to disclose “classified” information and the public’s right to know about its government’s activities. The day after The Times unveiled the first excerpt, President Richard Nixon attempted to stop further publication through a federal court injunction. The landmark Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. United States, decided several weeks later, upheld the right of The New York Times and other newspapers to disclose information contained in the report under the First Amendment.Today, the full text of the Pentagon Papers was declassified and—for the first time in history—posted online in its entirety and without redactions. According to a release issued by the National Archives, 34 percent of the report—2,384 pages—has never before been available to the public. The original hard copy of the report covers 7,000 pages and fills 48 boxes.

Mounting death tolls and controversy over how the war was being conducted fueled the antiwar movement, which was initially led by students but soon grew to involve prominent figures and people outside the United States.

He ordered his department to prepare an in-depth history of American involvement in the Vietnam War based on existing files. The 47-volume report, officially titled \"United States-Viet Nam Relations, 1945-1967: A Study Prepared by the Department of Defense,\" was delivered to his successor, Clark M. Clifford, in January 1969, nearly a year after McNamara resigned from his post.

By 1969, Ellsberg had begun attending antiwar protests and decided that the war was unjust. In October 1969, he and a colleague covertly photocopied the Pentagon Papers. He shared the document with a select group of officials, scholars and reporters, including Neil Sheehan of The New York Times. On June 13, 1971, the paper began publishing excerpts of the study, which painted a startling picture of government deception and policy blunders.
