In most cases, more greenhouse gases were produced during the manufacturing of the turbine then saved during use.\n\u201cThese studies have shown a large variation in the expected CO2 payback periods from a few months in good locations to situations where they never pay back, in poor locations.\u201d\nSimmons also blogs at Thoughts on Global Warming\nVia :: Reuters\n\u2026and if you subcribe to our RSS feed, we\u2019ll give you a free album.
