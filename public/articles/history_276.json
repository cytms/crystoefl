In return for tens of billions of dollars in loans to help Greece avoid bankruptcy, the European Union and International Monetary Fund have required steep cuts in government spending, and the Greek Ministry of Culture and Tourism\u2014charged with overseeing thousands of archaeological sites and more than 100 museums with antiquity collections\u2014hasn\u2019t escaped the ax.\nAccording to the Association of Greek Archaeologists, a union of 950 archaeologists working for the federal government, 10 percent of the culture ministry\u2019s workforce was laid off or forced to retire last November. The association reports that the ministry\u2019s archaeological budget was slashed by 35 percent in 2011 and further cuts are proposed for 2012.\nTwo years of layoffs imposed by the government have halved the number of ministry security guards, which has forced some museums to close or cut back on operating hours. Last summer, a security guard shortage led the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, the country\u2019s premier repository of ancient Greek art, to shutter numerous exhibit halls. Staffing shortfalls also caused the archaeological site at Nemea, which includes the ancient Temple of Zeus, to close on Sundays.\nOf even greater concern is that, in a country where nearly all museums are state-run and crime is on the rise, security staffing cuts have left priceless antiquities more vulnerable to theft. Two high-profile robberies in the past couple of months have only intensified fears. In January, three pieces were stolen from the National Gallery in Athens, including a Pablo Picasso painting personally gifted by the artist himself to the Greek people in recognition of their resistance to Nazi Germany during World War II. It was the first robbery in the museum\u2019s 112-year history. Just weeks later in Olympia, two armed thieves broke into the Museum of the Olympic Games\u2014which had reduced security staff\u2014and tied up the lone guard on duty before making off with 77 priceless bronze and pottery artifacts.\nAnother challenge is securing Greece\u2019s 19,000 archaeological sites\u2014attractive targets of illegal treasure hunters, looters and smugglers in the best of economic times, let alone when one in five Greeks workers is unemployed. Earlier this month, Greek police arrested 44 people suspected of smuggling ancient artifacts out of the country. Authorities recovered more than 9,500 ancient coins, jewelry pieces, bronze statuettes and wooden icons, some dating back to the sixth century B.C. The items had been unearthed in illegal archaeological digs, mainly in Macedonia and Thessaly.\nThe Greek newspaper Ta Nea reported that increased looting of archaeological sites was of such concern to Aristotelio University archaeology professor Michalis Tiverios that he successfully lobbied the Greek government to rebury a previously unknown early Christian basilica in Thessaloniki. \u201cMother Earth is the best protector of our antiquities,\u201d Tiverios told the newspaper. \u201cLet us leave our antiquities in the soil, to be found by archaeologists in 10,000 A.D., when Greeks and their politicians will perhaps show more respect to their history.\u201d\nWhile street protests against austerity measures have received considerable news coverage around the world, the cuts to the culture ministry have not captured as much notice. In response, the Association of Greek Archaeologists has launched an international appeal to draw attention to the vulnerability of the country\u2019s ancient artifacts and to oppose any further cuts to the culture ministry\u2019s budget.\nThe archaeologists are trying to dispel the notion that all branches of the Greek government, including the culture ministry, had become severely bloated and in need of sharp reductions. They point out that the ministry accounts for less than 1 percent of the national budget. \u201cThe Greek Archaeological Service is not overstuffed, nor are we being overpaid,\u201d the association said in a statement. \u201cFurther personnel cuts would mean that the Ministry of Culture will be unable to cover even its basic needs.\u201d\nThe association has incorporated social media into its global campaign, even launching a Facebook page titled \u201cI support Greek cultural heritage against IMF/EU cuts.\u201d Members are encouraging people to send protest emails to the Greek culture minister and prime minister as well as download posters depicting ancient mosaics, paintings and sculptures. The tagline for the posters reads: \u201cMonuments have no voice. They must have yours.\u201d","author":"Christopher  Klein","web_category":"news","title":"Are Greece\u2019s Ancient Treasures Under Threat?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/greece-treasures.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/are-greeces-ancient-treasures-under-threat"}
