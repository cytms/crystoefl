Instead of a green plant eater, he is a black time eater who looks like something straight out of one of H.R. Giger\u2019s paintings. Meet Chronophage, who eats one second at a time and is part of the Corpus Clock in Cambridge that sometimes goes backwards.\nThe Corpus Clock in front of Corpus Christi College\u2019s new library in Cambridge, England looks somewhat like the huge, golden end of a pendulum with a scary, metallic giant grasshopper on top, not much like an actual clock. The lack of hands and dial and the fact that the clock is accurate only every five minutes don\u2019t help either. \nPhoto: \nImage: William Marnoch\nIt is the invention of Dr. John Taylor, British engineer, horologist (watchmaker) and philanthropist, who inherited his inventive genius from his father, owner of a company that made controls for electric kettles \u2013 and ultimately Taylor\u2019s fortune. Together with a team of engineers, designers, architects, sculptors and enamellers, Taylor worked for five years and spent ¢G1 million ($1.4 million) of his own money. He gifted the clock to Corpus Christi College, which he graduated from in 1959, to give back to his old alma mater, and to provide the residents of Cambridge with both a new way of telling the time and a piece of public art. \nThe fanged insect on top that looks like a grasshopper with a cat\u2019s head grabs one spoke of the escape wheel every second, while blinking and slowly opening and closing its mouth every minute. On the hour, a clanking chain makes a sound that reminds you of one of those old cash registers. Maybe a memento that time is money? \nDr. Taylor clarifies the unusual depiction of a \u201ctime eater\u201d in a Daily Mail interview: \n\nThe Corpus Clock is a mechanical spring-driven clock modelled after John Harrison\u2019s \u201cGrasshopper Escapement\u201d of 1725, and is a tribute to that great 18th-century clockmaker who solved the longitude problem that had kept Galilei, Halley, Newton and others busy for so long. Though the inside works like traditional clockwork, it incorporates six new patented inventions. The clock is wound up by an electric motor that it is said will last for the next 25 years.   \nPhoto: \nImage: Slideshow Bob\nThe main part of the clock is made of stainless steel discs, about 1.5 metres in diameter and plated with 24-karat gold. Hours, minutes and seconds are displayed \u2013 from the inside out \u2013 on three concentric rings, with the help of blue LEDs ticking away the seconds loudly. Unlike the grasshopper, the pendulum does not move in regular intervals: it slows down, speeds up and sometimes stops altogether like time dragging, flying or standing still. Explains Dr. Taylor:     \n\nThat should have been achieved \u2013 and so too a dialogue with visitors, a steady stream of which has been coming to Cambridge. Descriptions of the clock have ranged from fantastic, beautiful and genius to strange, weird, frightening, creepy, hideous and horrible. Yes, the viewers\u2019 verdicts range from work of art to piece of crap. Stephen Hawking probably captured the clock\u2019s essence best when, inaugurating it on 19th September 2008, he predicted it to be \"a much loved and possibly feared addition to Cambridge's cityscape.\"  \nOne thing is sure: the clock has popularized the term \u201cchronophage,\u201d which was suggested by Ian Brooks of Chambers Dictionaries. It is a composition of Greek chronos (time) and phago (I eat), giving the adjective \"time-consuming\" a whole new context. \nStephen Hawking at the clock's inauguration on 19th September 2008:Photo: \nImage: Erik Kennedy\nAnd of course, with all things philanthropic or too good to be true, there are sceptics galore (just google Corpus Clock conspiracy, for example). Conspiracy theorists get hung up on the clock\u2019s inscription \u201cmundus transit et concupiscentia eius\u201d as a gloomy end-of-time verdict (from John 2:17) that \u201cthe world passeth away, and the lust thereof\u201d \u2013 though this seems more a reminder that the world is passing but that materialism remains. But then again, for sceptics, half an hour gone by will never mean half an hour remaining.  \nOne piece of interesting news in closing (though it seems one can go on talking about this \u201cstrangest clock on earth\u201d). The clock\u2019s Latin inscription, \u201cinvenit et fecit\u201d, stands for \u201cinvented and made\u201d, a term that 18th-century French horologers used to engrave their pocket watches with once they were recognized as original by the Royal Academy of Sciences.  \nFor those who really can\u2019t get enough of the Corpus Clock, here is a five-minute video, narrated by Dr. Taylor himself, which explains the clock\u2019s many mechanisms. And don\u2019t forget \u2013 after watching the video, the Corpus Clock will have been accurate only twice. Repeated viewing recommended! \nSource: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
