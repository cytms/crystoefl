Two minutes to midnight: In September 1953, at the height of the Cold War, the world moves closer to its demise.\nThe Doomsday Clock\u2019s minute hand nearly brushed midnight in September 1953. The move happened after the United States and the Soviet Union each tested a thermonuclear device within a nine-month span. \u201cThis demonstrated an acceleration of the arms race,\u201d said Benedict, \u201cand there was no communication between the two countries at all, even behind the scenes.\u201d It remains the closest the hand has ever stood to midnight. \n3. Twelve minutes to midnight: In October 1963, as the nuclear arms race eases, the clock hand backs away from doomsday.\nTo de-escalate the arms race and reduce the effects of excessive nuclear fallout on the environment, leaders from the three major nuclear powers\u2014the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union\u2014signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which prohibited above-ground nuclear testing, in August 1963. In response, the Doomsday Clock\u2019s hand moved comfortably away from midnight, conveying the Bulletin\u2019s increased optimism.\n4. Seven minutes to midnight: As more nations enter the arms race and war rages around the world, the clock hand inches closer to midnight in January 1968.\nWith China and France obtaining nuclear capabilities, the U.S. war in Vietnam escalating, India and Pakistan at odds and renewed hostilities in the Middle East, the BAS lamented the state of global security by moving the Doomsday Clock hand forward to ring in January 1968. \u201cThere is little reason to feel sanguine about the future of our society on the world scale,\u201d the Bulletin proclaimed at the time.\n5. Three minutes to midnight: In January 1984, the Doomsday Clock\u2019s hand creeps close to midnight as the two superpowers stop talking.\nAfter a decade of relative arms stability, the Cold War reached new heights between 1980 and 1983 as the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the United States pulled out of the Moscow Olympics and communication between the two superpowers all but ceased. The Bulletin took these as ominous signs and advanced the Doomsday Clock hand as close to midnight as it had stood since the arms race began in 1949.\n6. Seventeen minutes to midnight: With the Cold War over, in December 1991 the clock\u2019s hand retreats far from the midnight of humankind\u2019s destruction.\nFollowing the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union, in 1991 the BAS took the exceptional step of holding a public symposium to discuss the meaning of these events and invite discussion about the state of global security in the aftermath of the Cold War. \u201cThis was a time they literally went off the charts\u201d in debating the position of the Doomsday Clock hand, Benedict said. Finally, in December 1991, after the United States and Russia signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and began slashing their nuclear arsenals, the Bulletin moved the clock hand 17 minutes away from midnight to reflect this unprecedented moment of peace and cooperation between the superpowers.\n7. Five minutes to midnight: Expanded to include threats from climate change and emerging technologies, the Doomsday Clock reflects urgent danger to civilization in January 2012.\nIn 2007, the BAS broadened the scope of threats represented by the Doomsday Clock to include not only nuclear weapons but nuclear energy, climate change and \u201ctechnologies not created with malice aforethought, like synthetic biology, but technologies that nonetheless could spell doom for civilization today,\u201d Benedict said. In placing the clock hand at five minutes to midnight in January 2012, the Bulletin cited \u201cclear and present dangers of nuclear proliferation and climate change\u201d as the motivation behind the move toward doomsday.","author":"Elizabeth  Hanes","web_category":"news","title":"The End of Civilization?: 7 Moments in the History of the Doomsday Clock","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/doomsday-clock.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/the-end-of-civilization-7-moments-in-the-history-of-the-doomsday-clock"}
