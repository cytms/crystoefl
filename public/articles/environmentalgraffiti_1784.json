The design was created by Antonello Romano (graphic design) and implemented by Alfred Armstrong\u2019s Likemind (web development company). They are both awesome and I\u2019d highly recommend them. We\u2019d also really appreciate your feedback. Here are some of the new things coming up:\n\n\nWe\u2019re also working on a private beta, which has everything from the ability to create profiles to subscribing to news sources and even creating your own blog. This should open in Sept/Oct \u2013 feel free to sign up here.\nI\u2019d also like to thank a few people:\n\n\nAbout him\nRobin is a great musician: he used to be signed to Virgin with a band called Goldrush and is now in a band called The Champions of the World. He also runs a couple of big festivals, notably Truck and Wood.\nHow we met\nI met Robin at a festival called Two Thousand Trees. I had a crappy stall there made of recycled bits of plywood from my garage, so he came up to me and told me just how crappy it was.  We had a massive argument, but then quickly realised we had a lot in common and became great friends!\nWhy I\u2019m grateful to him\nRobin took pity on me and put me up in his office for a year. He\u2019s always been kind and patient and given us a lot of support. He\u2019s also a big environmentalist. Without his help, I don\u2019t think Environmental Graffiti would be around today.\n\n\nAbout them\nJoe and Claire are a super cool couple. Joe is Robin\u2019s brother and used to be in Goldrush and is now in the Champions of the world. Claire is an awesome graphic designer and together with Joe, they run Truck.\nThey\u2019ve given me a lot of support through the last year and for that I\u2019m really grateful.\n\n\nAs I\u2019m only 20, it was really difficult to get going on a big project like EG. My old man, who is already up to his eyeballs in work running professional services PR company Spada, not only provided me with extremely helpful advice (and continues to), but also funded the creation of the website. Thanks Dad, you rule!\n\n\nWithout you guys coming to read the site, it wouldn\u2019t be here today. I love ya all!!!!\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
