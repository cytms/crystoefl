This is the first time that the whole fossil, including the organism's soft tissue, has been found; in the past it was just a few tubes. As you can see in these remarkable images, this is the whole creature, tentacles included.\nPhoto: Professor Derek Siveter, Oxford UniversityThis is the detail of 525 million-year-old hemichordate\nProfessor David Siveter, of the University of Leicester's Department of Geology, said: \"Amazingly, it has exceptionally preserved soft tissues \u2013 including arms and tentacles used for feeding \u2013 giving unrivalled insight into the ancient biology of the group.\" Its name is Galeaplumosus, which means 'feathered helmet from beyond the clouds'. Yunnan itself means 'south of the clouds'.\nThis is another important piece of information which will aid our understanding of evolutionary history, and the researchers aim to continue to study the find for the next few months.","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"science","title":"525 Million-Year-Old Fossil Discovered in China","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/white-baby_3.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-525-million-year-old-fossil-feathered-helmet-beyond-clouds-1"}
