Well, painter and sculptor Erika Iris Simmons a.k.a. iRI5 has come up with a very creative solution: tape pictures. See for yourself how Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison look in tape and other artworks by Simmons.\nA graduate of Washington University in St. Louis with a bachelor\u2019s in Russian, Simmons is now a freelance artist and currently lives in Georgia. Apart from her own art, she also works on commercial projects. She says about her work on her website: \u201ciRI5 has developed an innovative style that focuses on recycling found materials, such as old cassettes and used books, turning trash into treasure.\u201d\nFrom the \"Ghost in the Machine\" series: Bob DylanPhoto: \nImage: iRI5\nDon't think that Simmons has used a black marker to help her tape collages - no, if you look closely, you can see that even Dylan's jacket is made up of lines of cassette tape!\nContext is everything when looking at Simmons\u2019 collages. She is detail-oriented and incorporates scenes or artworks from the lives of the person she\u2019s portraying into her work. Her series \u201cGhost in the Machine\u201d is a number of portraits of musicians made out of recycled cassette tapes. Knowing Simmons\u2019 attention to detail, she probably made Jimi Hendrix\u2019s portrait from an old cassette of his, Bob Dylan\u2019s from an original tape, and so on.\nJim Morrison, charismatic singer of the Doors, as never seen before:Photo: \nImage: iRI5\nHere\u2019s a collage of Ian Curtis, late singer of Joy Division. Simmons used parts of the lyrics from his song \u201cPassover\u201d for the collage: \u201cI think the words lend a beautiful metaphor to the actual life of the singer, who sadly suffered from depression and committed suicide. But, I hope, it sounds ironically optimistic.\u201d\nPhoto: \nImage: iRI5\nAnd Salvador Dali, composed out of parts of his own paintings:Photo: \nImage: iRI5\nHere's Barack Obama, made up of scenes from his life:Photo: \nImage: iRI5\nWe spotted iRI's cassette tape paintings first on Neatorama and will keep looking out for more from this promising artist.\nSource: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
