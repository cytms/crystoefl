And you wouldn\u2019t blame him, but his father assured him it was all perfectly safe (even though he had bought extra insurance on the hire car \u201cjust in case\u201d).\nSecond Time LuckyPhoto: \n3/4 rotationPhoto: \nA Tesla coil was placed on top of the car with a rod projecting out and bent towards the ground, from which the sparks would fly. A wooden counterweight was then placed on top to make sure it stayed in place. When the electric current was switched on and the rod turned to encircle the car, under long exposure the results are electrifying.\nSource TeslaDownUnder\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
