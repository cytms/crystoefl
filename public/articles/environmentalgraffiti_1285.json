Yes, the simultaneously serene and geologically seething landscape of Iceland is a reminder that there\u2019s no more sparkling a creative maestro than Mother Nature herself. And nowhere epitomises this more than the geothermal lagoons of the country\u2019s N?maskar? pass.\nPhoto: Image by: bishop72 via Hottnez \nN?maskar? is renowned for its volcanic clusters of bubbling mudpots, or solfataras, as well as its fizzing jets of volcanic gasses and steam, called fumaroles.\nSolfatarasPhoto: Image by: **ANNE via Hottnez\nWhere water is in short supply in a geothermal hotspot like Iceland, what little aqua vita there is rises to the surface in places where the ground is rich in volcanic ash and clay. Solfataras are born. The sheer size of the boiling mud pools \u2013 metres across \u2013 is awe-inspiring in itself. Mix in the beauty of the colourful mineral deposits they produce, and the fact that they\u2019re also known as paint pots seems even more appropriate.\nPhoto: Image by: sweden otsi\nWhile you absorb the colours on display here, it\u2019s worth remembering you should also keep some distance. Better to avoid letting the sulphurous fumes get up your nose. Better too to watch your step. Get too close to the mud springs, and the ground around may be liable to crumble. And while the absence of security guards adds to the freedom of the place, it also means there\u2019s no one to fish you out if you land in a simmering spot of bother.\nPhoto: Image by: little frank\nThe lack of vegetation, hot, turbulent activity, and pervasively sulphurous fog of this magnificent location gave wanderlust-fuelled blog Hotnez the feeling of having arrived at a gateway to hell. But with the flood of incredible hues vying for your attention, an artistic heaven seems just as conceivable.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
