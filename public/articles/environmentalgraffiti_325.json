Fact is \u2013 they are a pest to those plants they devour, sucking out their last drops sap. How\u2019s that for a gruesome image from the plant versus insect world?\nPhoto: Anauxite\nHm, yummy romp:Photo: Anauxite\nAccording to Bugs of the World (1993), aphids are \u201camong the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions.\u201d Ha - there you have it. Pesky little suckers. When it comes to group dynamics, however, and successful survival, plant lice can\u2019t be beaten.\nCome with me, my little innocents, there is a game that we can play...Photo: Anauxite\nThey get together in the hundreds if not thousands and attack the roots, leaves and shoots of a plant. Though some plant lice species are choosy and prefer only one particular plant to munch on (it\u2019s called being monophagous), there are many others that feed on a great variety of plants. The plant below may be okay, but the aphid is definitely a goner...\nAnd now for the innards\u2026Photo: Anauxite\nIn addition, aphids travel great distances by letting themselves be blown away by the wind or through accidental transportation on infested plants via humans. \nAh, almost done\u2026Photo: Anauxite\nIf these little buggers are so efficient, how come not all our plants are infested with them? Good questions but despair not, luckily there are natural predators. One such predator is the ladybird beetle (coccinellidae), more commonly known as a ladybug or ladybird.\nPhoto: Anauxite\nLike a true knight in often bright red shining armor, the ladybug just loves plant lice. In fact, some Asian ladybird species were introduced to North America as recently as 1988 and to Europe in 2004 to combat plant lice \u2013 successfully, so far. \nLet me turn you around:Photo: Anauxite\nHow much they love the lice and how exactly they devour them is apparent very apparent in this incredible sequence of pictures.   \nThat was good\u2026 and for desert - lice legsPhoto: Anauxite\nYou see it\u2019s true what your mother told you \u2013 do take time to eat your food and chew every bite carefully. Even the ladybug does. A truly amazing sequence that doesn\u2019t need much explanation. Next time you see some lice on your plant, just wait, the friendly neighborhood ladybug can\u2019t be far away, waiting to come to the rescue. If you want to see more ladybugs, here\u2019s an article on some interesting ladybug gymnastics...\nAnd now, maybe a nap? Or maybe not?Photo: Anauxite\nWith special thanks to Flickr user Anauxite for her stunning ladybird captures. \nSources: 1, 2, 3","author":"Simone Preuss","web_category":"nature","title":"Ladybug Devours Aphid","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Firestick_1_450px-Euphorbia_tirucalli_003.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/animals/news-ladybirds-devouring-aphids"}
