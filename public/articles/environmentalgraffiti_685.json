To many, they\u2019re poetic examples of nature\u2019s spectacular qualities, though if you were a more humble critter you might think fireflies and glow worms just a bit too flash...\nPhoto: Photinus Pyralis Firefly Photo: art farmer\nSo let\u2019s see. Are lightning bugs and their like all show and no go, or do they have the substance to back up all that style? What\u2019s more, how do you tell who\u2019s who amidst all the glitz?\nAnyone else feeling claustrophobic? Lightning bugs in a jar with long exposurePhoto: Photo: talkingplant\nFirst up, some of the terms used to describe our bioluminescent buddies are somewhat misleading. Glow worm, for example, commonly refers to various different groups of insect larvae and adult larviform females \u2013 so called because they look like larvae \u2013 which glow through bioluminescence. They may look like worms, but they\u2019re not; they\u2019re insects. Don\u2019t just take someone\u2019s word for it about the model of their pimping new car; look under the hood and see for yourself.\nI say if you\u2019ve got, it flaunt it: Female Common Glow-worm in the grass, UKPhoto: Photo: timo w2s\nNearly all the major glow worm families are beetles (pretty difficult to confuse even with a poor man\u2019s Porsche) and these include Rhagophthalmidae, found in Asia, Phengodidae, distributed through the New World, and Lampyridae, commonly called fireflies and found across the globe. Again rather confusingly, not all fireflies that glow can fly and not all that fly can glow \u2013 and none are true flies like another group of glow worms, Arachnocampa, of which more later.\nSmouldering with desire: Female Lampyris noctiluca Glow-worm, GermanyPhoto: Photo: Wofl\nLampyris noctiluca, the Glow-worm of British English and literature, is widespread in Europe but not native to America. It\u2019s a firefly species in which the male flies but does not glow \u2013 or does so only weakly and intermittently \u2013 while the wingless adult female shines brightly. Giving off yellowish-green light, the female alluringly turns her translucent rear-ends upwards and waves it from side to side to attract her smaller, less resplendent mate, which can see the glow from 50 yards. Yes sir.\nDid someone get paint on the lens? Fireflies in the forest with 30-sec-exposurePhoto: Photo: Quit007\nJust so we don\u2019t go blind with confusion \u2013 or at the sight of all this hot insect porn \u2013 many of the 2000-plus species of fireflies can fly and produce light, especially the males. These lightning bugs use their eye-catching bioluminescence, which may be yellow, green or pale red in colour, to attract mates or prey. Those of genera like Photinus, common in the eastern US, are distinguished by courtship flash patterns emitted by males burning around in search of females, who flash their responses.\nNoo-nee-noo-nee-noo: Photinus pyralis firefly mid-flightPhoto: Photo: Photos: art farmer\nFemale Photuris fireflies are known for mimicking the mating flashes of other lightning bugs to prey upon them: target males are attracted to what appears to be a suitable mate only to find they\u2019re on the menu for these \u201cfemme fatales\u201d of the firefly world. Many firefly species are found in wetland where their rapacious larvae \u2013 again often called glow worms as they too emit light, probably to warn predators of their toxicity \u2013 can find ample supplies of food to prey on. Mmm-mmmm.\nOK guys, on three: Synchronised flashing patterns, Elkmont, TennesseePhoto: Photo: Judd Patterson\nThe mesmerising magic of lightning bugs doesn\u2019t stop here. Fireflies sometimes synchronise their flashing patterns in large clusters. At night in the Malaysian forests, Pteroptyx fireflies blink in perfect unison, while near Elkmont, Tennessee another famous example of fireflies flashing as one \u2013 Photinus carolinus \u2013 takes place in early June.\nPerfect synchronisity: Pteroptyx fireflies in a mangrove apple tree in Malaysia Photo: Photo via: Nature\nThe causes of the these breathtaking displays of biological synchronisity remain something of an enigma, with explanations of the behaviour ranging from competitive or co-operative social interaction to diet and altitude. Amid the mystery one thing is sure though: they're a supreme example of one of nature\u2019s very own co-ordinated light shows.\nNice glow sticks: Phengodidae larvae glow worm in a cave in BelizePhoto: Photo: dudley bug\nChristmas tree? Railroad wormPhoto: Photo via Curious Expeditions \nGlow worms of the family Phengodidae are another with bioluminescent abilities that make them stand out from the crowd. Occurring throughout the Americas, the predatory larvae and large larviform females have a series of organs along their body segments that give off green light as they go about munching on morsels like millipedes. The unique species known as the railroad worm also has an organ in its head that glows red \u2013 an adaptation believed to help discourage predators.\nBeetle bum: Asian glow worm from the Rhagophthalmidae familyPhoto: Photo via Insect-fans\nThe Rhagophthalmidae family of glow worms found in Asia are closely related to the Phengodidae glow worms and various species of Lampyridae fireflies \u2013 and may indeed be related to Luciola, a \"Japanese firefly\" with a distinctive kind of flashing light. In each of the different families of glow worms, the glow is produced by different organs, but in all cases it is the result of highly efficient chemical reactions that give off virtually no wasteful \u2013 or dangerous \u2013 heat energy. Cool \u2013 and green.\nStarry starry night: Still glow worm lights and threads, Waitomo, New Zealand Photo: Photo: stunner vivian \nThe last glow worm to grace this post is a little different from the rest as it\u2019s not a beetle at all but the larva of a genus of fungus gnat. Found mainly in caves in Australia and New Zealand, Arachnocampa larvae spin long silk threads holding mucus droplets that they hang down from their nests to catch prey. They glow to lure various flying insects into their snares, possibly through the illusion that the cave roof covered with larvae is a starry night sky. Hungry larvae glow brighter. Oh yes.\n Glow worm heaven: More Arachnocampa larvae glow worms in Waitomo's cavesPhoto: Photo: milkthebasic\nHad enough insect bling yet?\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
