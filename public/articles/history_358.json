Determined to pursue a scientific career, Marie struck a deal with her sister Bronya, agreeing to fund Bronya\u2019s medical degree in France by working as a governess. Bronya later helped Marie move to Paris and enroll at the prestigious Sorbonne, where she studied chemistry, math and physics.\n\u2022 Curie met her future husband, Pierre, while doing postgraduate research at the lab he supervised. The pair immediately bonded over their mutual interest in magnetism and fondness for cycling, and a year later they were married in Sceaux, France. They used the money they had received as a wedding present to purchase bicycles for the many long rides they took together.\n\u2022 In 1896, intrigued by the physicist Henri Becquerel\u2019s accidental discovery of radioactivity, Curie began studying uranium rays; Pierre soon joined her in her research. Two years later, the Curies discovered polonium\u2014named after Marie\u2019s homeland\u2014and radium. In 1903 they shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel for their groundbreaking work on radioactivity.\n\u2022 The first woman to be granted a Nobel Prize, Curie later became the first person to earn a second one. In 1911 she received the prestigious award\u2014in chemistry this time\u2014for her isolation of radium and other accomplishments.\n\u2022 After Pierre\u2019s tragic death in a 1906 accident, Marie was appointed to his seat at the Sorbonne, becoming the university\u2019s first female professor. (Just three years earlier, she had been the first woman in France to earn a doctorate.) Today, France\u2019s leading scientific and medical complex bears the name of both Curies.\n\u2022 During World War I, Curie used her radiography expertise to set up dozens of mobile and permanent X-ray stations, which helped doctors diagnose and treat battlefield injuries. They became known as \u201cpetites Curies\u201d for their famous creator.\n\u2022 Decades of handling radioactive materials\u2014the effects of which were poorly understood at the time\u2014ultimately took a toll on Curie. By the 1920s she had developed muscle aches, anemia, cataracts and a host of other symptoms. She died on July 4, 1934, of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation.\n\u2022 Curie\u2019s daughter Ir?ne followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps, earning a doctorate in physics and conducting important research on synthesized radioactive elements. In 1935 she and her husband, Fr?d?ric Joliot, shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificial radioactivity.\n\u2022 In 1995 the remains of Curie and her husband were enshrined in Paris\u2019 Pantheon, a mausoleum reserved for distinguished French thinkers. She became the second woman to receive this honor and the first to earn it through her own achievements.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"Remembering Marie Curie on Her 144th Birthday","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/marie-curie-portrait.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/remembering-marie-curie-on-her-144th-birthday"}
