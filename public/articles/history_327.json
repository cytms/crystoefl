The fearsome felids, which disappeared 10,000 years ago, used their pairs of 7-inch-long maxillary canines to dispatch large game with repeated slashes to the throat. Faster and gorier than the suffocating bites of modern big cats such as lions, this method could backfire if the prey thrashed about, causing Smilodon to chomp on bone and shatter one of its fragile, knife-like fangs. And what good is a saber-toothed predator with a broken saber?\nAfter publishing a study on the phenomenon, Meachen-Samuels began to wonder whether the pattern applied to other saber-toothed creatures distantly related to Smilodon but not considered Felidae, or cats. Millions of years before Smilodon prowled the Americas, certain members of the Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae families\u2014sometimes known as false saber-toothed cats\u2014also boasted elongated canines. Did they have beefy, big-boned arms to boot? To find out, Meachen-Samuels measured the fossilized limbs and teeth of hundreds of museum specimens of the extinct carnivores. She also included 13 cat species still living today, such as the tiger and clouded leopard, in her analysis; these modern felines have short, conical teeth less prone to fracture.\nThe results showed a distinct correlation between forelimb thickness and upper canine length, implying that strong arms evolved with saber teeth in other species besides Smilodon fatalis. \u201cI had a good idea that I would find this trend based on previous studies and preliminary data that I had collected for this project, but when I saw the data plotted out I was excited,\u201d Meachen-Samuels recalled. She noted that the pairing arose in at least three families of prehistoric predators at different times over 40 millions years, making it an excellent example of convergent evolution, in which species that are not closely related acquire similar features to meet the same needs.\n\u201cThese traits evolved as not only a suite of characters but as a viable, distinctive prey-killing strategy several times independently,\u201d Meachen-Samuels explained. \u201cThis combination probably evolved several times because the predators that could best protect and preserve their teeth during prey killing survived longer and had more offspring, thereby making this combination of long teeth and strong forelimbs a winning combination.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Powerful Arms Saved Saber-Toothed Killers\u2019 Fearsome Fangs, Study Shows","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/smilodon.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/powerful-arms-saved-saber-toothed-killers-fearsome-fangs-study-shows"}
