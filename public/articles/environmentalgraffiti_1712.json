Japanese artist Yuken Teruya works with everyday objects to craft wonderfully intricate worlds, producing art out of the mundane and discarded. Cardboard toilet paper rolls are one medium for his creative expression, but he has also worked with pizza boxes, McDonald\u2019s bags, flags and more.\nOn his website, Teruya writes:\nWith no materials added and nothing taken away, Teruya cultivates miniature forests using his own deft skill and simple tools to cut out the shapes and fold the paper into place. What was once a tree is arboreally reborn. And if, like less privileged paper products, these art works are ever disposed of, they will help to fertilise future forests.\nSuch works are part of Teruya\u2019s wider project of transforming the meaning of commonplace items in order to explore wider issues in contemporary culture. These include its \u201cgrowing consumerism\u201d and problems associated with globalism such as \u201cdepleting natural resources\u201d. Way to give us the heads up.\nSources: Booooooom! via Neatorama, plus Yuken Teruya's own website\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
