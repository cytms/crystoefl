While it resembles a lizard, it\u2019s equally related to both lizards and snakes. This has made them the subject of intense study in relation to the evolution of both snakes and lizards. It has also given us information about the appearance and possible habits of the ancient diapsids.\nWhile the animal has been helpful in the study of lizard and snake evolution, it appears its own evolution is remarkable in itself.  Although the animals have stayed generally unchanged at a physical level, at a DNA level they are evolving faster than any other animal yet studied.\nLead researcher Prof David Lambert of New Zealand\u2019s Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution, said \u201cWhat we found is that the tuatara has the highest molecular evolutionary rate that anyone has measured.\"\nThe study analyzed the DNA structure of ancient tuatara bones and compared them with the DNA structure of modern tuatara. They found that the animal has been evolving quite rapidly.\nLambert said: \"Of course we would have expected that the tuatara, which does everything slowly \u2014 they grow slowly, reproduce slowly and have a very slow metabolism \u2014 would have evolved slowly. In fact, at the DNA level, they evolve extremely quickly, which supports a hypothesis proposed by evolutionary biologist Allan Wilson, who suggested the rate of molecular evolution, was uncoupled from the rate of morphological evolution.\u201d\nThe tuatara is the only surviving member of reptilian order Sphehodontia, which appeared alongside early dinosaurs. It\u2019s found only in New Zealand, where it has been classified as an endangered species since the late 1800s. It faces continuing ecological challenges in the form of habitat loss and rats.\nInfo from Times of India \nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers' choice awards.
