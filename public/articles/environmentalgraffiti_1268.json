Five volunteer firemen in Centralia overlooked this when they set fire to a landfill site in a mine pit, before dumping more hot coal and ash on top. \nPhoto: Image: jessegimbel\nThe subterranean fire gradually spread, enveloping the surrounding coal fields, and locals were only alerted in 1979 when a gas-station owner discovered the fuel in his underground tanks was an incredible 77.8¢X C (172¢X F). Shortly afterwards a 12 year old boy almost died when the?extreme heat forced open a 46m (150 ft) subsidence crack beneath him.\nPhoto: Image: sim\nToday Centralia is a ghost town \u2013 its population evacuated in 1984 and its memory long since erased from the map. The state claimed eminent domain over the town\u2019s buildings in 1992, demolishing the majority of them, and those that remain sit silently among the desolate open spaces and smouldering vents that now dominate the area.\nPhoto: Image: Joyey Jojo\nAnd the fire still burns, engulfing an area of over 1.6km? (400 acres), with scientists estimating the presence of enough coal to feed its flames for the next 250 years. The large amount of carbon monoxide in the air and ground riven by extreme heat ensures residents won\u2019t return to Centralia for some time.\nPhoto: Image: Lyndi & Jason\nThe lonely cemetery that sits atop the hilltop, gently smouldering, marks not only the final resting place of those who long ago brought mining to the area, but also the demise of a town that is destined to remain silent for many decades to come. There will, however, always remain hope that Centralia might some day return to its former glory \u2013 that it might rise from the ashes.\nPhoto: Image: mattzcoz\nSources: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
