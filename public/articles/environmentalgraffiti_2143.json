This would make it, in effect, just like any other lake, pond, or body of water, and give it the same murky green hue.\nThe lake, which is over 1,600 feet deep, has an abundance of nutrients in the depths, but must be able to circulate oxygen to that level in order to support life, something which happens as the entire body of water repositions itself every four years.\nWith that mixing action shut down, the nutrients would instead be consumed by algae, eventually leading to the greening of Lake Tahoe.\nInfo from Yahoo News.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
