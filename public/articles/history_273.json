It also had important social and behavioral implications, encouraging groups of people to gather together and stay up late. Despite the significance of kindling flames, when and where human ancestors learned how to do it remains a subject of debate and speculation. There is even little consensus about which hominins\u2014modern humans, a direct predecessor or a long-extinct branch\u2014first acquired the skill.\nThe oldest unequivocal evidence, found at Israel\u2019s Qesem Cave, dates back 300,000 to 400,000 years, associating the earliest control of fire with Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. Now, however, an international team of archaeologists has unearthed what appear to be traces of campfires that flickered 1 million years ago. Consisting of charred animal bones and ashed plant remains, the evidence hails from South Africa\u2019s Wonderwerk Cave, a site of human and early hominin habitation for 2 million years.\nThe researchers found the evidence in a layer of rock containing hand axes, stone flakes and other tools attributed by previous excavations to a particular human ancestor: Homo erectus. Characterized by its upright stance and robust build, this early hominin species lived from 1.8 million to 200,000 years ago. \u201cThe evidence from Wonderwerk Cave suggests that Homo erectus had some familiarity with fire,\u201d said Francesco Berna, an archaeology professor at Boston University and the lead author of a paper on the team\u2019s findings.\nOther groups of researchers armed with remains from Africa, Asia and Europe have also claimed that human fire control originated very early\u2014up to 1.5 million years ago. These studies, however, rely on evidence from open-air sites where wildfires could have blazed, Berna said. And while scorched objects were found and analyzed, the deposits surrounding them were not, meaning the burning could have taken place elsewhere, he added.\nWonderwerk Cave, by contrast, is a protected environment less prone to spontaneous flames. What\u2019s more, an analysis by Berna and his colleagues showed that sediment clinging to charred items there was also heated, suggesting fires were kindled onsite. For these reasons, the team described the singed traces unearthed at Wonderwerk as \u201cthe earliest secure evidence for burning in an archaeological context.\u201d\nScientists working outside the realm of archaeology\u2014most notably primatologist Richard Wrangham\u2014have persuasively argued that Homo erectus tamed fire, Berna noted. Wrangham has long been championing the theory that cooking allowed human ancestors to consume more calories and, as a result, to develop larger brains. He has largely based his hypothesis on physical changes in early hominins\u2014for instance, a shift toward smaller teeth and stomachs\u2014that took place around the time Homo erectus evolved.\n\u201cSo far, Richard Wrangham\u2019s cooking hypothesis is based on anatomical and phylogenetic evidence that show that Homo erectus may have been already adapted to a cooked food diet,\u201d Berna explained. \u201cOur evidence from Wonderwerk is consistent with Homo erectus being able to eat cooked food.\u201d\nBerna and his colleagues have been excavating at Wonderwerk since 2004, but more work is on the horizon, he said. In addition to seeking even earlier evidence of fire control, the researchers plan to investigate whether the cave\u2019s Homo erectus inhabitants actually cooked\u2014for instance, by checking for cut marks on bones, Berna explained. \u201cMore work needs to be done to exclude that meat was consumed raw and bones were disposed in the fire after that,\u201d he said.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Human Ancestors Tamed Fire Earlier Than Thought","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wondererk-cave.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/human-ancestors-tamed-fire-earlier-than-thought"}
