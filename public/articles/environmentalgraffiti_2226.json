The study shows a 50% reduction in CO2 absorption between the mid 90s and 2000-2005.\nThe report, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was the result of a 10-year study in the North Atlantic by scientists at the University of East Anglia. The scientists warn that global warming could become even worse if the world\u2019s oceans aren\u2019t absorbing greenhouse gases. Researchers are worried by the findings because they suggest that the world\u2019s oceans may, in time, actually become saturated with emissions.\nThis is especially worrying due to the oceans\u2019 role in absorbing carbon. The ocean is one of two main carbon sinks, the other being the land \u201cbiosphere\u201d, which each absorb a fourth of the world\u2019s carbon emissions. \nEnvironmental analyst Roger Harrabin of the BBC says: \"The researchers don't know if the change is due to climate change or to natural variations. But they say it is a tremendous surprise and very worrying because there were grounds for believing that in time the ocean might become 'saturated' with our emissions - unable to soak up any more.\" \nSource: BBC\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"science","title":"The Oceans Aren't Sucking, And That Blows","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Global-Warming-effectsjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/the-oceans-arent-sucking-and-that-blows/343"}
