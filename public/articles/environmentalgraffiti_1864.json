They can happen to anyone, at any age. In fact, these days heart attacks have become the leading cause of death, especially in women. \nIf a person\u2019s heart muscles are not supplied with enough oxygen-rich blood, it can increase the risk of a heart attack. And once the blood becomes too thick, it can also damage blood vessels. Aspirin aside, there are relatively few blood-thinning drugs available on the market. Sadly, they also have their side effects. \nIn a recent study, Professor Rongjia Tao from Temple University in Philadelphia, PA has invented a safer and repeatable technique for thinning human blood by subjecting it to a magnetic field. \"This method of magneto-rheology provides an effective way to control the blood viscosity within a selected range,\" said Tao.\nPhoto: Credit: Rongjia TaoAggregated red-cell clusters have a streamlined shape, leading to further viscosity reduction. \nProfessor Tao discovered that the magnetic field polarizes the red blood cells, causing them to link together in short chains. But how? \u201cThe hemoglobin in red blood cells is an iron-containing protein capable of binding oxygen molecules. Therefore, red cells have a higher magnetic susceptibility than the blood\u2019s base liquid, plasma,\u201d explained Rongjia Tao in an email. \u201cIn a strong magnetic field, red cells are thus polarized and aggregate into short chains,\u201d he added.\nPhoto: Credit: Rongjia Tao(a)without magnetic field applied, the red blood cells were randomly distributed in the plasma, (b) After a strong magnetic field of 1.33T applied for one minute, short red-cell chains are formed, (c)when applied for 12 minutes, red-cells aggregated to form long-cluster chains\nThe findings were tested on various blood samples, and the research paper is soon going to be published in the journal Physical Review E. It states that if a magnetic field of 1.3 Telsa is applied for a minute, it reduces a person's blood viscosity by 20-30%. Later on, it regains original viscosity over a period of several hours in the absence of the magnetic field.\nFurther research is required to develop this technology. One might wonder if it affects the red blood cells' normal function. Or how safe it is to use magnets to prevent a heart attack? Professor Tao answers: \u201cUp to date, for our knowledge, a static magnetic field up to 3 Tesla is usually quite safe. Of course, we should always be cautious about any new technology, which may have some unknown side effect.\u201d\nSource: 1, and research paper","author":"Alka Sharma","web_category":"science","title":"Could Magnets Help Prevent Heart Attacks?","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb03.webshots.com-44034-2858545440105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-how-magnets-could-help-prevent-heart-attacks"}
