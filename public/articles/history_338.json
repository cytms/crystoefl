If leaves had simply blown into the site from the forest, there would have been several different tree species represented.\u201d\nThe team determined that Sibudu\u2019s sporadic inhabitants were bunking down on these natural sleeping bags as far back as 77,000 years ago, making the site\u2019s ancient bedding 50,000 years older than other known examples. People probably collected sedges and grasses from the nearby river valley to blanket the shelter\u2019s hard rock floor, Wadley said. Tools and charred boned found among the plant layers imply that the mats also served as comfortable surfaces for sitting, eating and working during the waking hours, Wadley explained.\nSince insects that carry fatal illnesses are endemic to Africa, the bedding at Sibudu might have improved health conditions at the camp and even saved lives. \u201cEven when mosquitoes are not malaria vectors, their bites can cause infection and disease,\u201d Wadley noted. \u201cThe protection of small children from biting insects would have been especially important for preventing child mortality. The leaves may have repelled flies, too, and flies are another cause of disease.\u201d\nAround 73,000 years ago, the people of Sibudu began burning their bedding before packing up to leave, archaeological evidence shows. An important clue to the nomadic population\u2019s habits, this suggests that they frequently returned to the same shelter, Wadley sad. \u201cBurning fusty bedding was a way to clean up the site for instant re-use,\u201d she explained. It also sheds light on how the people of Sibudu harnessed fire for more than just cooking, warmth, protection and manufacturing adhesives for tools, she added. \u201cOur research adds that fire was used as a sanitizing agent that enabled a camp site to be occupied repeatedly,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bedding was burnt primarily to rid it of pests\u2014insects and perhaps rodents\u2014and to clean up decaying organic material.\u201d\nPrevious research by Wadley and her colleagues has painted a detailed picture of the lifestyle and culture of Sibudu\u2019s population during the Middle Stone Age. Moving frequently between shelters and open-air campsites, they used spears and other weapons to hunt large animals such as zebras and buffalo. Along with stone and bone tools, they crafted ornaments from seashells. But the bedding discovery in particular rounds out our understanding of their daily lives, Wadley said. \u201cArchaeologists tend to focus on rare finds such as early ornaments and engravings,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, domestic activities, like preparing and destroying plant bedding, can also provide important information about changing settlement patterns and even demography.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"World\u2019s Oldest Known Beds Repelled Bugs","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/gathering-sedges.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/worlds-oldest-known-beds-repelled-bugs"}
