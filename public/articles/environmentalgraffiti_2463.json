Presumably at least some will donate them.\nDespite that momentary humanitarian bent, this is a prank at heart-- the web page says so very clearly: \"I'm not quite sure what the reason behind this is, other than the fact that a global shortage of carrots would be quite a laugh.\" Yes, yes it would. Obviously the dimwits haven't noticed the global food crisis. \n[Facebook][Metro][Arborath]\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
