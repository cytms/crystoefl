Scientists claim to have created \u201cSpiderman\u201d gloves based on study of the gecko\u2019s adhesive powers.\nThe gloves don\u2019t stick to a surface like glue, instead they stick when the gloves start to slide. This directly mimics the way geckos climb walls using hair like structures called setae on their feet.  The current prototype works on smooth glass surfaces, but the scientists are developing the adhesive for other purposes. Pure \u201cSpiderman\u201d climbing gloves could be available in 3 to 5 years, according to University of California-Berkeley professor Ron Fearing.\nAll I can say is they\u2019d better be. I have a bit of a pet peeve when it comes to this sort of technology. I guess you can say I\u2019ve had my heart broken before. I\u2019ve been waiting for commercially available superpowers basically my entire life, and I\u2019m sure quite a few of you feel the same. So let me run down a few of the incredibly awesome things science has announced, but have not managed to reach my living room.\n1. Super strength\nThere are fairly regular announcements of various exoskeletons, almost always meant for soldiers, that will allow the wearer to perform some feat of strength. Usually it\u2019s not particularly amazing but something along the lines of letting a soldier walk longer and faster or carry 200 pound packs or something. But occasionally they\u2019ll hype it by saying you could punch through a brick wall or something. This bionic suit may one day have nanofibers that actually make your muscles 35% stronger. I want one. Now. And I bet real soldiers would too. Get on it quick, Pentagon.\n2. Invisibility Cloaks\nThis one\u2019s courtesy of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is always being promoted as the greatest thing that will ever hit mankind, with an ever growing list of amazing things it might be able to do. But there\u2019s the rub, it\u2019s always what it MIGHT someday do.  A Harry Potterish invisibility cloak has been proposed as one potential benefit. Basically, the cloak would work by using metamaterials to bend light around the wearer with the magic of physics.  This is super theoretical physics and hasn\u2019t been developed, making me wonder why people ever suggested this was a possibility rather than some scientist\u2019s geeky dream.\n3. Super healing\nAnother nanotech idea, although this one is actually being developed and could one day be real. It\u2019s not exactly like something off of Heroes though. In one case, nanofibers could soon help brain damage caused by strokes or other injuries. I\u2019ve even heard tell of magical nanorobots that could go into your bloodstream one day and cure you of various diseases. I\u2019m putting most of my eggs in this particular basket. It seems the most likely to happen and the \u201csuperpower\u201d I\u2019ll one day most desire.\nI eagerly await superpowers available at a retailer near me. Maybe in a few years we\u2019ll meet climbing up a skyscraper. If one of us falls, tiny robots can heal us. I\u2019m keeping my hopes up. I may have been disappointed before, but I\u2019m not giving up on being a superhero just yet.\nIf you want to find out more crazy science news, why not subcribe to our RSS feed?
