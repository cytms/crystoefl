Think about it, wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if your girlfriend had the ability not only to change the channel on tv, wash the dishes, cook your dinner,  but also charge your ipod or mobile phone? Maybe that last comment explains why I don\u2019t have a girlfriend.\nIn all seriousness though, as our friends over at Alternative consumer put it \u201cFrom the \u201cslap a solar panel on anything and make headlines\u201d department comes Triumph Internationals.\u201d Yep, you\u2019ve got it, it\u2019s a photovoltaic solar powered bra and of course, it\u2019s made in Japan. No surprises there\u2026\nThe concept bra of course requires light, which is a bit of a problem, since most people don\u2019t tend to go out in their underwear. You also can\u2019t wash it, which of course adds to the archetypal smelly treehugger\u2019s appeal.\nNotwithstanding this, company spokesperson Yoshiko Masuda assures us that it does send the message of how lingerie could possibly save the planet. Hmmm, interesting angle there.\nOther weird inventions from the same company include a bra that turns into a reusable shopping bag \u2013 bigger breasts here must obviously mean that you can carry more shopping.\nBut should we really be laughing at such fascinating and weird examples of green-washing? After all, this is a great publicity stunt and can only add fuel to the eco-friendly fashion movement.\nWe\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nPhoto: Image via DVICE\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
