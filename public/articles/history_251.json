Before long, experts and the press were hailing the South African fish as the \u201cmost important zoological find of the century\u201d and a \u201cliving dinosaur.\u201d Fourteen years later, an obsessive hunt by Smith and his wife finally turned up a second modern coelacanth specimen, and dozens more have surfaced over the years. Scientists determined that, rather than dying out 65 million years ago, coelacanths lurked under the depths and the radar, remaining largely unchanged over time. Today the fish are endangered and extremely rare.\nDecades after Courtenay-Latimer\u2019s landmark discovery, a study published May 2 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology opens a new chapter in coelacanths\u2019 long and enigmatic history. Researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada have described a new species of coelacanth, dubbed Rebellatrix, which turns the standard definition of these famous \u201cliving fossils\u201d on its head. The extinct creature also overturns the idea that coelacanths\u2019 bodies and lifestyle barely evolved after the animals first appeared 400 million years ago, the researchers said. \u201cRebellatrix means \u2018rebel coelacanth,\u2019 so named because this new coelacanth goes against the norm for coelacanths,\u201d said lead author Andrew Wendruff. \u201cIt does things scientists thought coelacanths could not do.\u201d\nRebellatrix first appeared after the extinction event that wiped out 90 percent of marine life at the end of the Permian period, roughly 250 million years ago. It could have evolved its unique anatomy to fill a niche left vacant by predatory fish species that didn\u2019t survive Earth\u2019s most severe mass die-out, the researchers hypothesized. The strategy ultimately failed, however, Wendruff explained. \u201cWhile other fork-tailed fishes appear later in the fossil record, Rebellatrix and its descendants are noticeably absent,\u201d he said. \u201cThis leads us to believe that Rebellatrix was a dead end in the evolution of cruising predation.\u201d\nWhatever the reason for its atypical features, Rebellatrix shows that coelacanths weren\u2019t stubbornly frozen in time from their earliest history until today, according to the study. \u201cThe new body form, particularly the tail, was most surprising because it shatters the commonly held notion that coelacanths were an evolutionarily stagnant group in that their body shape and lifestyle changed little since the origin of the group,\u201d said Wendruff. \u201cRebellatrix is dramatically different from any coelacanth previously known, and thus had undergone significant evolutionary change in its ancestry.\u201d\nThe researchers described four Rebellatrix fossils collected within the vicinity of Wapiti Lake Provincial Park in British Columbia. Some 240 million years ago, this area was located off the western coast of Pangaea, Wendruff said. The first fossil was unearthed in the 1950s, and the most recent was found in 2007. Rebellatrix\u2019s discovery comes on the heels of another coelacanth revelation: Chinese scientists announced two weeks ago that a coelacanth skull dates back 409 million years, suggesting the ancient creatures could be 17 million years older than previously thought.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Killer Fish Rebellatrix Not Your Typical Coelacanth","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/rebellatrix.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/killer-fish-rebellatrix-not-your-typical-coelacanth"}
