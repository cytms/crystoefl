The gas can reach temperatures of up to 20 million degrees Fahrenheit (12 million degrees Celsius) \u2014 about 2,000 times hotter than the sun's surface \u2014 as it nears the center. The hot gas shines in low-energy light known as \"soft\" X-rays.\n?\n\n\n?\n\"Black holes are truly exotic, with extraordinarily high temperatures, incredibly rapid motions and gravity exhibiting the full weirdness of general relativity,\" Julian Krolik, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, said in a statement. \"But our calculations show we can understand a lot about them using only standard physics principles.\"\n?\nScientists have also observed black holes producing light with energy tens to hundreds of times greater than soft X-rays. The origin of these \"hard\" X-rays was a mystery before the research team modeled the process.\n?\nSchnittman and his team found that the density, speed and temperature of the gas are increased by magnetic fields in the disk, creating a \"turbulent froth orbiting the black hole at speeds approaching the speed of light,\" NASA officials wrote in a statement.\n?\nThe magnetic pressures on the disk create a corona above it that leads to the production of hard X-rays.\n?\nThe scientists used 27 days of data from the Ranger supercomputer located at the University of Texas, Austin to produce these results. The findings were published in the June 1 issue of The Astrophysical Journal.\n?\nFollow Miriam Kramer on Twitter and Google+. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+.
