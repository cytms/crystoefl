When he's not swatting away mosquitos or cooking delicious food over his camp stove, he's spending his time writing code for Blockie.io, a platform that will allow programmers and website developers to easily create back-end services for Internet applications.\n?\nHere is the tent that he is working out of:\n?\n\n?\nBacklund has two Brunton Solaris 62 panels, which can be easily rolled up for transportation.\n?\n\n?\nBacon, eggs, and a little java (both coffee and code) by the lake. Not a bad way to spend the summer.\n?\n\n?\nIt will be interesting to see how this goes and to hear how forest-coding works out for Backlund. If he pulls this off, we could see a large exodus of coders moving to the woods next summer to work. If you're going to be hunched over a keyboard for 80 hours a week, why not do it next to a beautiful lake/meadow/bubbling brook?\n?\nSwing over to ThomasBacklund.com to follow along on his wilderness coding adventures.\n?\nHungry for more tales of people living the unconventional life?
