The site, located in Rome\u2019s Largo di Torre Argentina archaeological area, once housed the Curia of Pompey, a meeting place within the larger Pompey\u2019s Theater. The complex was built around 52 B.C. by Caesar\u2019s rival Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, who would succumb to his own assassination in 48 B.C.\nAncient chroniclers recount that tensions between Caesar and members of the Roman Senate escalated in 44 A.D. after he was named dictator perpetuo (dictator for life) and appointed his allies to rule the republic during his upcoming military campaign. On March 14\u2014known as the Ides of March\u2014he arrived at Pompey\u2019s Theater for a Senate session and entered the Curia of Pompey, taking his place in a chair to address the hundreds of lawmakers gathered before him. Led by Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus, a group of senators then stepped forward with hidden daggers and stabbed Caesar 23 times.\nCenturies later, William Shakespeare would immortalize this grisly scene in his play \u201cJulius Caesar.\u201d But first, the CSIC researchers believe, Caesar\u2019s adopted son Augustus marked the site of his father\u2019s murder with a concrete memorial 10 feet wide and over 6 feet tall. It is this structure that archaeologists believe they\u2019ve unearthed during their excavation of Largo di Torre Argentina. \u201cWe always knew that Julius Caesar was killed in the Curia of Pompey on March 15, 44 B.C.,\u201d CSIC\u2019s Antonio Monterroso explained in a statement. \u201cBut so far no material evidence of this fact, so often depicted in historicist painting and cinema, had been recovered.\u201d\nLocated in the center of Rome, Largo di Torre Argentina is known today for its thriving cat sanctuary, in which photogenic felines pose for tourists\u2019 cameras atop ancient ruins. According to AFP, the area will be opened to the public in 2013, granting visitors access to the very spot where Julius Caesar met his bloody end.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Julius Caesar\u2019s Stabbing Site Identified","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/julius-caesar-stabbing.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/julius-caesars-stabbing-site-identified"}
