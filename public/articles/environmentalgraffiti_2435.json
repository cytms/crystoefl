Since then, the yearly event to turn the lights down low (and preferably off) to raise awareness about climate change and the perils of unchecked greenhouse gas emissions has become a worldwide observance. Over 4,000 cities in more than 80 countries took part in this year's event on March 28. With many a major city participating, just what did those famous skylines and landmarks look like before and after the lights went out?\nBoston.com has collected some pretty cool animated pictures that gives you the power to turn the lights \"on\" or \"off\" with just a click of your mouse in 17 cities around the world, including Shanghai, Jakarta, Paris, Ahtens, London, Toronto, Lima and Los Angeles. While the differences were not so great in some cities, others had a great showing, with quite dramatic drops in light levels. In any case, it's a compilation of some nice, big pictures of some of the world's most recognizable places!\nIf you're interested in some great video footage, check out the Earth Hour site.\nSources: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
