The Chariot is one of the new prototypes for NASA's next generation lunar rover.  Taking a cue from the Mars rovers, it will have six wheels, each with it's own independent steering.\nThe current rover, active since the 70s, like the shuttles, will be replaced with a vehicle capable of carrying out much larger missions.  The new rover will move passengers and freight as well as geological samples.  It will be a truly all-purpose machine.  The intention is to power all of this with liquid-oxygen and -hydrogen rather than batteries.\nPhoto: Image: Stuart Fox/NASA\nRight now, the vehicle's color comes from anodized aluminum.  Should the vehicle reach full production, the astronauts who use it will be cruising the Moon in a much more expensive thermal coating of gold.  A true chariot for the men on the Moon.\nSources: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
