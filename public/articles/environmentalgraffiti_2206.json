The bull was given his status after a 1994 fight in the world\u2019s largest bullring in Mexico City. \nLivestock cloning company ViaGen will clone the animal in Canadian laboratories. The animal will be cloned from samples taken from his ears and feet. Bull owner Jose Manuel Fernandez said: \"We believe this animal deserves to keep reproducing himself. We are going to do four copies because two cattle ranchers have asked me for them and I am going to keep two.\u201d  Zalamero has already sired 100 offspring.\nThe genetic samples were collected by ViaGen\u2019s Mexican director Jose Cordoba, who hopes to deliver the clones in a year and a half.\nSource: Reuters\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"science","title":"Famous Fighting Bull to be Cloned","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/flickr-237481352-hd.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/famous-fighting-bull-to-be-cloned/496"}
