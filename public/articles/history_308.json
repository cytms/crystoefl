Created as an auxiliary branch of Britain\u2019s Royal Air Force, the WRAF allowed women to aid the war effort by in pitching in behind the front lines and freeing up men to serve in combat. During her time with the WRAF, Green served as a waitress in the officer\u2019s mess at two Norfolk-area bases, Narborough Aerodrome and RAF Markham. She was on active duty for the final two months of the war, until the armistice was declared on November 11, 1918.\nGreen spoke fondly of her wartime service, and the opportunities it afforded her, once referring to it as the \u201ctime of my life.\u201d But it might have surprised many that Green, who suffered from a lifelong fear of flying, would choose the WRAF as her field of service. As she herself noted in an interview,?\u201cI met dozens of pilots and would go on dates. I had the opportunity to go up in a plane but I was scared of flying.\u201d\nGreen remained with the WRAF until July 1919. Shortly afterward, she married railway worker Walter Green, and the couple moved to King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk, where they raised three children. Walter died in 1975. Green remained in the area and lived with her eldest daughter until late last year when she was admitted to a local nursing home, where she passed away in February 2012. At the time of her death, she was the sixth oldest person in Britain.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2009 that Green\u2019s role in the war and her status as one of its final survivors was revealed. After reading a Norfolk-area newspaper article on Green\u2019s 108th?birthday and her early years serving in the war, a researcher and genealogist discovered her service records in the British National Archives. Green\u2019s standing as one of the last remaining World War I survivors was officially recognized the following year.\nBritish-born Claude Choules, the last known World War I combat veteran, died in Australia in May 2011. In February 2011, Frank Buckles of Charles Town, West Virginia, the last known American non-combat veteran, passed away.

There are no known German or French survivors.\nGreen was two weeks shy of her 111th?birthday, an event that was to have been commemorated by the RAF with a special service.
