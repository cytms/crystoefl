But see for youself and join us on our musical tour of \u201cI Spy\u2026.\u201d San Francisco. \nSan Francisco is the fourth most populous city in California, and the whole of the San Francisco Bay Area is home to more than seven million people. During the gold rush of the 19th century, the city was literally a \u201cGolden Gate\u201d for many adventurous fortune seekers. Though its old name Yerba Buena (from the Spanish hierba buena, the \u201cgood herb\u201d) was changed in 1847 after the Mexican-American war, the term still has a valid (yet different) meaning for many today. \nSan Francisco is located at the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula and is framed by the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay. Characteristics of the cityscape are the grid-like structure of the city blocks, the many parks and green areas, bridges and islands belonging to the city.   \nThe northern tip of San Francisco with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background and the Bay Bridge in the foreground.\nHello, San FranciscoPhoto: \nImage: Roy Tennant\nHere's a view of the southwestern end of San Francisco with Lake Merced in the foreground and the city skyline in the background. \nCalifornia Dreamin\u2019Photo: \nImage: Phil Whitehouse\nMoving further north, here\u2019s the Pacific Ocean and Lake Merced in the foreground and the Golden Gate Park and the Presidio on the horizon. \nSan Francisco on the WaterPhoto: \nImage: Roy Tennant\nA beautiful panoramic shot of the city with the Sutro Tower on the left, the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin County in the distance. \nWelcome 2 Da BayPhoto: \nImage: Roy Tennant\nThe Golden Gate Park stretching from east (top) to west (bottom).

After being a lighthouse, a military fort and prison and a federal prison until 1963, Alcatraz today is a national recreational area that features popularly in movies and on TV.    \nHoliday on Alcatraz IslandPhoto: \nImage: druchoy\nHere's a view of the Bay Bridge on the left and the city skyline and the typical street grid, making it look a bit like downtown New York.\nFrisco TownPhoto: \nImage: Roy Tennant\nThe Bay Bridge and Yerba Buena Island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay between San Francisco and Oakland.
