In recognition of that fact, over 2.3 million people visited the site last year--from all 50 American states and 197 countries.\nFor ten thousand dollars, you can buy the rights to the ozone hole - nobody else has claimed it, except for the ozonhole.com of course. Anyway, when I last looked there weren't any bids. It turns out I don't think anybody wants the thing after all.Environmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
