Apparently, even since the ban, CFCs have been permitted in medical products when the FDA deems them essential. But that is about to end as the FDA recently announced that asthma inhalers that use CFCs?will be banned at the start of the new year.\n\n\t?\n\n\tRight now, the inhaler under scrutiny is Primatene Mist, a popular asthma inhaler used by roughly 2 million patients each year. It's also the only over-the-counter inhaler currently?available in the U.S. market without a prescription. Primatene Mist uses CFCs?to propel medicine out of the inhaler so it can be drawn into the lungs. According to the FDA, other asthma-inhaler manufacturers now use a propellant called?hydrofluoroalkane, which is less harmful to the environment.\n\n\t?\n\n\tPrimatene Mist is marketed by Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, a unit of?Amphastar.?Two other prescription asthma inhalers that use CFCs are to be phased out by the end of 2013. They are Boehringer Ingelheim's Combivent Inhalation Aerosol and Graceway Pharmaceuticals' Maxair Autohaler.","author":"","web_category":"health#allergies","title":"FDA to ban certain asthma inhalers","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/primatene.jpg","url":"http://www.mnn.com//health/allergies/blogs/fda-to-ban-certain-asthma-inhalers"}
