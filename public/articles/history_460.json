They uncovered Roman military ditches containing late Iron Age pottery as well as Roman ceramics and horse harnesses from the mid-first century A.D. Based on this evidence, the team hypothesized that Roman soldiers busy sacking Britannia under orders from Claudius had discarded these items after capturing the surrounding area and before heading to their next target.\n\u201cIt seems that when the army moved on they dug pits and buried their broken equipment,\u201d Wilkinson explained.\nReturning to the site on April 22 for additional work that is still ongoing, Wilkinson and another group of trainees stumbled upon something else that the Romans might have considered equally dispensable. \u201cThe body of a young girl with a dramatic wound to the back of her head was literally dumped in and just actually buried and covered over,\u201d Wilkinson said.\nIn good health at the time of her death, the woman was probably felled by a Roman sword while in a kneeling position, he conjectured, adding, \u201cThis poor girl was obviously of use to them while they were camped there, but her usefulness ran out when they moved on and they killed her.\u201d\nWhile ancient Roman texts describe how invading armies plundered British towns and slaughtered their inhabitants, little evidence has been found of such widespread carnage. One of the most noteworthy examples is the famous British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler\u2019s discovery in the 1930s of a mass grave at Maiden Castle in which people had been buried after suffering violent deaths. The placement of the young girl\u2019s corpse and the ostensible circumstances of her death provide insight into how the Roman invaders may have treated indigenous Britons, challenging one classic theory that Britain prospered and advanced under foreign rule.\nTwo years ago, Wilkinson and a team of archaeologists unearthed another young female victim\u2014a teenager who had been decapitated, possibly because she was accused of witchcraft\u2014near a church in Rochester, Kent. She was given a funeral service and proper burial some 700 years after her death. The remains of the Faversham girl will be reburied at the site where she was found.\n\u201cIn this small evaluation trench on the corner of a potential marching camp we come across a little cameo of tragedy, really,\u201d Wilkinson said, reflecting on his most recent discovery.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Girl Possibly Murdered During Roman Invasion Found in England","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kafs-dig.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/girl-possibly-murdered-during-roman-invasion-found-in-england"}
