He\u2019s addicted,\u201d answered Mohammad when questioned on his actions as to why he introduced smoking to his 18-months-old boy. \nOne fascinating yet sad thing about this is that the child only smokes one brand and the family spends US $5.00 a day for his bad habit. \nPhoto: FairDinkum\nThe child definitely can\u2019t be blamed for his addiction and the actions of his parents. Many blame two reasons for the boy's addiction: the father introducing smoking to his child and the mother taking no action to stop or prevent that from happening.  \nOfficials even tried to bribe the family with a car if they made the boy quit but his father disagreed: \u201cHe looks pretty healthy to me. I don\u2019t see any problem.\u201d\nRelated articles: \n2-year-old Child Smokes 40 Cigarettes A Day2 Year Old Indonesian Child Smoking VideoAnd you thought YOUR 2-year-old behaved badly...","author":"JannMartin","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Indonesia's 2 Year-Old Chain Smoking Baby","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/temple10.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/health-and-body/news-2-year-old-indonesion-child-smokes"}
