Therefore, veganism is becoming more and more attractive. Many vegans still want the convenience of buying prepackaged meals though, just as with any other diet. \nDaiya Cheese - very pleasing to the taste buds and it melts!Photo: DaMori Belanger\nThe problem is that many of these prepackaged foods are made with unfermented soy. Unfermented soy contains chemicals that have toxic effects on the body. The fermentation process of soy actually releases the nutrients, thus turning it into a healthier food. Without that process, there are little to no health benefits. \nAlso, a number of soy companies continue to use the neurotoxin, hexane, to process soybeans. Hexane is toxic to the body and to the environment. For those who prefer convenience, there are tasty meat and dairy alternatives out there that are also soy free. \nVegan Meat and Soy AlternativesPhoto: DaMori Belanger\nArtichoke Burgers and Grilled Patties by Five-Star Foodieshttp://www.fivestarfoodies.com/\nField Roast Deli Slices, roasts, \"Meatloafs,\" and \"Sausages\" http://www.fieldroast.com/\nSunshine Burgershttp://www.sunshineburger.com/\nQuinoa Burgers - Whip up a batch and freeze some for later!http://www.deeplyvegan.com/2009/11/quinoa-burger.html\nHelpful Resource:\nDirty Secret of Natural Soyfoods","author":"damoribelanger","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Finding Vegan Alternatives to Soy","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/7-foods_veggies.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/food-and-drink/news-going-vegan-without-going-soy"}
