The San Francisco resident has some interesting reasons to sell the skeleton. Besides the cash the fossils would bring, she also needs the garage space. For the last few years, a rare mastodon skeleton has shared space with the Fiddler\u2019s workbenches.\nFiddler has also had to forego use of her sauna for the past few years, as the room was pressed into service as a makeshift bone repository. Fiddler said: \"We needed a safe, dry place. The mastodon takes precedence.\u201d Now, however, the young sons of the Fiddlers want to work on hot rods in the garage, so off goes the fossil.\nThe mastodon was discovered on a ranch owned by the Fiddlers in 1997. A ranch employee came across a tooth from the ancient mammal, which went extinct with the end of the last ice age around 10,000 years ago. After the tooth was found, further excavation revealed the nearly complete mastodon skeleton. Only the tusks were missing.\nThe skeleton was quite beautiful according to palaeontologists, and it spent several years on display as part of an exhibition at the Oakland Museum of Natural History.  The museum eventually made a replica for display, and the Fiddlers moved the skeleton to the tasting room of a wine bar before putting it in their garage.\nSome palaeontologists are annoyed with the Fiddler\u2019s decision to sell the piece and doubt they\u2019ll get the money they\u2019re seeking. Mark Goodwin, of the University of California\u2019s Museum of Palaeontology, said: \"What is it going to do? Sit on someone's mantle? I would prefer to see it donated to a museum. This is our fossil heritage.\u201d\nI\u2019ve always wanted to own a fossil, but I assumed that you had to have special conditions to store them in. Now that I know they can be shoved in saunas, garages and wine bars, I think I\u2019m going to go on a shopping spree. First step, raise $115,000. Can anyone spare some change?\nInfo from Reuters\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers' choice awards.
