March 12, 2006. Night. The wind outside the trailer grew louder and louder, like the sound of fighter jets closing in. Next thing, the locked front and back doors of the mobile home were blown off their hinges. Everything was wobbling \u2013 the floor, the walls, the ceiling \u2013 but nothing could prepare Matt Suter for what was about to happen. Seconds later, the tornado ripped the home apart and lifted the 19-year old high school senior into its jaws.\nTornado, Missouri, 2006Photo: Image: NWS Memphis\nSuter was carried nearly a quarter of a mile by the twister\u2019s raging 150 mph winds. He was hurled over a barbed wire fence 200 yards from his grandmother\u2019s shattered trailer and finally dropped in the soft grass of an open field. Incredibly, his injuries were limited to a wound on his head from where he was hit by a heavy lamp. Meteorologists calculated that he had been blown 1,307 feet \u2013 the longest recorded distance anyone has been transported by a tornado and survived.\nOldest known tornado photo, South DakotaPhoto: Image: NOAA\nBut if this whirlwind journey whisked Suter into the history books, he is not the first tornado passenger lucky enough to have lived through a trip in a wind vortex. Before Suter, the longest anyone had travelled in such an incident occurred in 1955 in South Dakota when a 9-year old girl and her pony were borne 1000 feet before being gently dropped down almost unscathed. Even last year, an 11-month old baby was sucked from his Tennessee home and flung the length of a football field by a tornado, landing with only slight facial bruising.\nTornado under observation, KansasPhoto: Image: Center for Severe Weather Research\nAnd it\u2019s not only living objects that have been taken for a ride by these formidable columns of air. A personal money cheque obtained the record for the longest distance a piece of debris has been carried by a tornado when in 1991 it was lifted up in Stockton, KS and later found 359 km (223 miles) away in Winnetoon, NE. The cheque clearly wasn\u2019t in Kansas any more, but at least its owner could have cashed it over the state border.\nOklahoma tornadoPhoto: Image: OAR/ERL/National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL)\nIn one final strange tale plucked from the mouths of these phenomenal funnels, in 1951 an egg was found among tornado wreckage that had been perfectly punctured by a bean without its shell being cracked. It seems that these incredible forces of nature are not without mercy \u2013 unless you happen to be an unborn chick that isn\u2019t fond of its legumes.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
