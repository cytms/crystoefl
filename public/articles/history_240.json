That day\u2014May 21, 1932\u2014she planned to end her journey at Paris\u2019 Le Bourget airfield, where exactly five years earlier Charles Lindbergh had completed the first solo transatlantic flight. When her Vega\u2019s reserve fuel tank sprang a leak and flames began engulfing the exhaust manifold, however, Earhart wound up navigating to a Northern Ireland pasture.\n\u201cI was never in Ireland before,\u201d Earhart later told reporters, \u201cbut the sight of the thatched cottages and the marvelous green grass and trees left me no doubt that I had actually made the Emerald Isle. I was still surer when I heard the brogue of my friend Dan McCallion.\u201d\nThrust into the spotlight as the first woman to soar over the pond, Earhart smarted at the attention, particularly when the press likened her to Lindbergh and dubbed her \u201cLady Lindy.\u201d She repeatedly emphasized that she\u2019d been a mere passenger on the trip, never even touching the controls, and didn\u2019t deserve any accolades. \u201cI was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes,\u201d she gloomily reminded a journalist. \u201cMaybe someday I\u2019ll try it alone.\u201d\nFour years later, as the five-year anniversary of Lindbergh\u2019s feat approached, Earhart had racked up enough training hours to feel ready. Many pilots had vied to become the second person to cross the Atlantic alone, but so far all had failed. One of them, the female aviator Ruth Nichols, was poised to make another attempt, and her plans goaded Earhart to act fast.\nWhen she encountered Dan McCallion 80 years ago, Earhart knew she\u2019d made history in her own right. Shortly thereafter, after drinking some water and washing up, the exhausted aviator hitched a ride into town, where she called her husband, George Putnam, and told him rumors of a crash in France had been greatly exaggerated. She then spent the night with the Gallegher family, owners of the farm where her plane still smoldered. The following day reporters materialized and armfuls of congratulatory correspondence began arriving. Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne, deep in mourning after the discovery days earlier of their kidnapped son\u2019s body, sent the first note.\nAs the world celebrated Earhart\u2019s triumph, some remained less effusive about her slightly abbreviated voyage\u2014including her own sister. \u201cOf course, any landing on land is good,\u201d Muriel Earhart Morissey told The New York Times. \u201cIt is much better than if she\u2019d landed in the water. I am sorry she did not get all the way to Paris, but, after all, a landing in Ireland makes the trip a success.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Amelia Earhart\u2019s Historic Landing, 80 Years Ago","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/earhart-londonderry.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/amelia-earharts-historic-landing-80-years-ago"}
