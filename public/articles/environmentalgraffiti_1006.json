There are more animals just like it moving into the area, including Chinese mitten crabs and the zebra mussel.\nThree years ago, a survey by the Marine Conservation Society found only 25 zebra mussels in a stretch of the River Thames near Richmond. Recently they conducted another survey, and found thousands of the invasive species. They also found a large amount of mitten crabs. Mitten crabs are a threat to native species because they dig into the river bed, washing away mud and making it hard for native shellfish to find shelter.\nThe invasive species compete with local species for food and habitat, and can wreak havoc on local shipping. The zebra mussel, in particular, has been a bane on the water. They block water pipes and mess up ship propellers with ease, causing millions in economic damage.\nSource: Telegraph\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.
