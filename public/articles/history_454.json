Under the heading \u201cTo Make Small Beer,\u201d it calls for a mixture of bran hops, yeast and molasses. (Until well into the 19th century, \u201csmall beers\u201d were weak-tasting, low-alcohol drafts considered suitable for children and meant to be consumed immediately after brewing, according to the library.) Washington begins by instructing readers to \u201ctake a large Sifter or Bran Hops to your Taste.\u201d He later specifies that the concoction must be boiled and let stand until \u201cBlood warm.\u201d\nThe first president\u2019s fondness for the effervescent malt beverage is well known, according to \u201cBrewed in America,\u201d Stanley Baron\u2019s 1962 history of beer and ale in the United States. When the British fled New York City on November 25, 1783, for instance, General Washington toasted the auspicious turn of events with a draught of ale at Manhattan\u2019s Bull\u2019s Head Tavern. After the American Revolution, when President Washington and his wife Martha entertained distinguished guests, they served bottles of porter from Philadelphia\u2019s most acclaimed brewer, Robert Hare.\nThe New York Public Library, which owns the notebook containing the recipe, announced last Wednesday that it was working with the Coney Island Brewing Company to resurrect the beer. Fifteen gallons of the porter, to be known as \u201cFortitude\u2019s Founding Father Brew,\u201d will be brewed to celebrate the library\u2019s 100-year anniversary. Sources are reporting that half the batch will follow Washington\u2019s specifications, while the remainder will substitute barley for molasses in an effort to please the modern beer aficionado\u2019s palate. The country\u2019s first president, who famously suffered from dental problems throughout his life, evidently liked his porter extra-sweet.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"Raising a Toast With George Washington\u2019s Beer","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gw-beer-recipe1.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/the-new-york-public-library-raises-a-toast-with-george-washingtons-beer"}
