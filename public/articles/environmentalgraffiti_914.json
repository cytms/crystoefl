As an American, I should have known better. The way to win isn\u2019t through the hearts and minds of Americans, it\u2019s through lawsuits.\nI\u2019m only half kidding. Lawsuits really can be particularly effective political devices.  That also seems to be the reasoning of the National Resources Defence Council, the Center for Biological Diversity and Greenpeace. They\u2019ve filed a lawsuit against the Bush administration for missing the deadline on whether to include the polar bear in the Endangered Species Act.\nThe government has been delaying the decision for months after missing a January 9 deadline. Campaigners believe this is because the government wants to sell oil and gas leases in polar bear habitat, an action that would be made much more difficult should the bear be named an endangered species.\nAndrew Weitzer, director of the NRDC\u2019s Endangered Species Project, said: \u201cThe Endangered Species Act is absolutely unambiguous: the Fish and Wildlife Service was required to make a final decision months ago. Now it\u2019s up to a federal court to throw this incredible animal a lifeline.\u201d\nKassie Siegel of the Center for Biological Diversity said: \u201cThe Bush administration seems intent on slamming shut the narrow window of opportunity we have to save polar bears.\u201d\nAccording to the NRDC:\n\n\nI commend the efforts of the groups. In a time when most lawsuits appear to be frivolous money grabs filed by ambulance chasing lawyers with bad TV commercials, it\u2019s refreshing to see one that\u2019s actually trying to make a difference.\nInfo from National Resources Defense Council\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers choice awards.
