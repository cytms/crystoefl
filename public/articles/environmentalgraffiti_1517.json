In Sweden, a posh ice hotel is there to accommodate anyone who wants to experience living inside ice.\nAptly named Icehotel, the Swedish ice hotel was the very first one in the world, before other countries like Norway, Russia, Canada and Finland followed suit. Icehotel is located in the Jukkasj?rvi village in the city of Kiruna, the northernmost city of Sweden. \nPhoto: Paul Mannix\nIt was founded by Yngve Bergqvist, who was trying to look for a way to attract tourists to Jukkasj?rvi during wintertime. In February 1990, Yngve Bergqvist and his team successfully constructed the first ice building. In 1992, the first clients came to sleep in it because almost all hotels and inns were booked. The rest, as they say, is history.\nPhoto: Wilfrid\nObviously, it was Mother Nature who provided the Icehotel's building materials: ice and snow from the nearby Torne River. A storage room was also built to house more than 10,000 tons of ice and over 30,000 tons of snow, all of which goes back to the river when the climate gets warmer.\nPhoto: Findfado\nWhat\u2019s even more fascinating about Icehotel is that it is being rebuilt every year, with different architecture and designs, making it not just a building, but a constant art project that offer a different experience to every visitor.

Icehotel has teamed up with Absolut Vodka to create the Absolut Icebar, all made of, what else, ice.\nPhoto: Eimoberg\nYou don\u2019t even need to tell the bartender to have your drink \u201con the rocks\u201d because the ice glasses will keep your drinks ice cold. And because very cold temperatures also kill bacteria, you\u2019re sure to have a very clean drink.\nPhoto: Rob Inh00d\nYou can also enjoy some outdoor activities offered by Icehotel: If you\u2019re an adventurer, you can try going up the mountains or down to the fjords. Skiing and dog- and reindeer-sledding are popular activities too. If you\u2019re the artistic type, you can try joining their ice sculpting sessions, where you can sculpt with crystal-clear ice, guided by professional artists, of course. But one thing you shouldn\u2019t miss is seeing the Northern Lights, or the phenomenal Aurora Borealis. You\u2019ll experience a light show like no other, as you can see from the pictures below.\nPhoto: Hugo\nPhoto: Image Editor\nIcehotel officially opens during the early days of December, when visitors can actually see the hotel being built. As weeks go by, rooms are added to accommodate more guests. If you love the night, December is the best time to visit, when the darkest nights arrive, and the sun doesn\u2019t rise for some time. Dark skies are best to see the Northern Lights. \nPhoto: Jim Trodel\nBut if you like it a bit warmer, Icehotel is open until April or May, depending on the weather. During these summer months, you just might get to experience the midnight sun, when the sun never sets, even until midnight. \nPhoto: Sami Kein?nen\nAt Icehotel, not only will you have your wish of a white Christmas fulfilled, but you\u2019ll also have the iciest experience of your life.\nPhoto: Wilfrid\nSources: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11","author":"Karize Uy","web_category":"art+and+design","title":"The Largest Ice Hotel on Earth","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/jinmao1jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/architecture/news-icehotel-biggest-ice-hotel-world"}
