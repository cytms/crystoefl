Over the years, experts have discovered more than 280,000 artifacts from the jewel of Blackbeard\u2019s fleet, which ran aground in June 1718. These include the cannons, an anchor, assorted weapons, shackles, gold dust and animal bones consistent with the humble fare that sustained buccaneers on their journeys across the Atlantic.\nLike other treasures from Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge, cannon C13 is encased in a cement-like shell of sand, salt and barnacles. But the gun has less corrosion than other finds, so even uninitiated onlookers could distinguish its outline, Wilde-Ramsing said. Of the 12 other cannons pulled from the site, four were found to be loaded, meaning that Blackbeards\u2019s men were primed for battle when the ship went down. One even contained spikes designed to slash sails and terrorize adversaries. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be on either side of that,\u201d Wilde-Ramsing commented. He said that these fearsome weapons might bear markings showing their country of origin, which could shed light on Blackbeard\u2019s short-lived command of Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge.\nBuilt by the British around 1710, Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge was captured a year later by the French, who converted the 300-ton vessel into a slave ship and dubbed it La Concorde de Nantes. In 1717, after a particularly brutal transatlantic crossing during which many crewmembers died or suffered from disease, La Concorde fell into the hands of Blackbeard and his followers. Some of the French sailors and slaves voluntarily joined the pirates, while those who could be of most use\u2014including a pilot, three surgeons and the cook\u2014were taken by force.\nIn May 1718, Blackbeard, now in control of three smaller vessels in addition to the flagship he dubbed Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge, blockaded the port of Charleston, South Carolina. The following month he attempted to enter North Carolina\u2019s Old Topsail Inlet, now known as Beaufort Inlet, where Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge and a second ship ran aground. (Some have suggested that the seasoned seaman did this intentionally in order to disperse his crew and lay claim to their spoils.) Blackbeard surrendered soon after and was granted a royal pardon from the colonial governor, only to return to a life of crime shortly thereafter and die in a battle against the Royal Navy on November 22, 1718.\nCannon C13 and other artifacts from the current mission will now be taken to a laboratory, where experts will begin \u201cthe bigger longer, phase of getting things cleaned, researched and stabilized,\u201d Wilde-Ramsing explained. This expedition marks the halfway point for the recovery team, which estimates that 50 percent of the pirate ship\u2019s riches\u2014including 11 more large cannons and two anchors\u2014still lie under the depths. \u201cOur hope is to really accelerate our efforts the next couple years to get all the remains up,\u201d said Wilde-Ramsing.\nWilde-Ramsing remarked that he thinks the project\u2019s fastidious approach and focus on conservation will \u201cset the bar high for underwater exploration.\u201d That\u2019s one of the reasons why the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources takes such great pride in the undertaking, he added. \u201cOur department\u2019s mission is to bring history to life, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Cannon Loosed from Wreckage of Blackbeard\u2019s Pirate Ship","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/qar-cannon-1-150x150.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/cannon-loosed-from-wreckage-of-blackbeards-pirate-ship"}
