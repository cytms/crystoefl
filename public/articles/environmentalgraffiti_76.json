The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ocean Explorer took a scientific expedition to the Canada Basin to get much needed information about climate change, and brought back these amazing images.\n10.

The males are rare and do not live long.\n6. Sea StarPhoto: Bodil Bluhm and Katherine Iken, University of Alaska, Fairbanks/NOAA 2005\nA stunning sea star brought up from the sea floor. Sea stars are a keystone species and have a huge effect on the surrounding environment and ecology.\n5.

It is a form of shell-less snail that lives close to the surface.\n2.

AulococtenaPhoto: Kevin Raskoff, California State University, Monterey Bay/NOAA 2005\nThe aulococtena lives between 350 and 1,100 meters deep in the sea and is the size and color of an orange. It has two sticky tentacles, one of which can be seen here. \nThere are thousands of microscopic animals in our world that we rarely get a chance to see and which are as beautiful \u2013 and often more unusual \u2013 than more common creatures we are used to.","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"nature","title":"10 Amazing Photos of Animals Hidden Under the Arctic Ice","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/800px-Olindias_formosa1.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-amazing-photos-animals-hidden-under-arctic-ice"}
