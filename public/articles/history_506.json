It was the largest amphitheater in the world at the time of its construction, capable of seating some 50,000 spectators, and was designed to epitomize the might and prosperity of imperial Rome. Today, more than 4 million tourists visit its ruins each year.\nThe subterranean tunnels of the hypogeum were added by Titus\u2019 younger brother, Domitian, a notoriously cruel emperor who staged particularly creative and brutal events at the Colosseum. (He reportedly enjoyed pitting female gladiators against male dwarves.) Along with chambers for the thousands of warriors who would meet their deaths above, the new basement housed giant cages for wild animals imported from the far corners of the empire, including elephants, leopards, panthers and bears. A pulley system allowed slaves and handlers to hoist the doomed creatures up to the main arena.\nOnly 35 to 45 percent of the Colosseum has been accessible to the public, but the opening of the hypogeum and the upper tier will double that figure, according to officials from Italy\u2019s culture ministry. Amid safety concerns raised earlier this year when chunks of mortar fell off an interior wall, both zones recently underwent restoration and cleanup work, officials said.\nTours of the newly opened hypogeum and upper tier will begin as early as next week, giving visitors new insight into the final moments of those who fought for their lives\u2013and almost certainly perished\u2013behind the Colosseum\u2019s majestic fa?ade.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"Rome\u2019s Colosseum Unveils its Underworld","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/colosseum-underground.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/romes-colosseum-unveils-its-underworld"}
