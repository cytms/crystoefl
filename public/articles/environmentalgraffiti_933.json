The state of Michigan, and the U.S. Forest Service, decided the best way to address the issue was with a quarantine, which accomplished absolutely nothing.  Despite the locking down (well, at least the attempt) the movement of ash trees, firewood, wood chips and the like, the little devil has moved into Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland, inspiring local quarantines, and leaving still more dead and dying trees in its wake.\nSo what does this have to do with baseball?  While I think I could replace all of the ash wood in your home tomorrow, and you wouldn't notice, it is the favorite of  most Major League Baseball players.  The forests owned by Louisville Slugger, which are in northern Pennsylvania, are safe for now, but spring is coming.\nBy new Environmental Graffiti contributor Ben Ray.
