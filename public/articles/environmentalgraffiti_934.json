The caterpillar eventually grows up to become the beautiful and graceful Asian Swallowtail butterfly, but during its juvenile stage it spends its time disguised as bird droppings.\nNow the researchers have discovered that the exotic animal\u2019s unique camouflage is the result of a special hormone evident only in the juvenile caterpillar, which is called juvenile hormone because scientists are apparently very uncreative.  High levels of this hormone make the caterpillar look like bird droppings, but levels drop as it ages and make the caterpillar look more like a leaf.\nJuvenile hormones have a lot of uses in insect growth. The hormones regulate development in the juvenile bugs, such as telling the insect when it\u2019s time to molt and when it\u2019s time to turn into a butterfly.  This research, however, is the first time that the juvenile hormone has been shown to be involved in the caterpillar\u2019s camouflage processes. Haruhiko Fujiwara was one of the scientists who worked on the project at Japan\u2019s National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences. He believes that the juvenile hormone may help to regulate the genes in charge of a caterpillar\u2019s colors and skin patterns.\nThe scientists didn\u2019t do any research into why exactly the caterpillar chose this particular disguise. They did venture a fairly safe guess that it probably keeps birds, one of the caterpillar\u2019s main predators, from trying to eat them.\nInfo from Reuters\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on animals and ecology, why not subcribe to our RSS feed?
