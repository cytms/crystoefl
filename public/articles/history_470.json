Caroline Erolin, a lecturer at the University of Dundee\u2019s Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification, described the process she used to transform 1,000-year-old bones into a lifelike reproduction: \u201cWe laser-scanned the skull to create a 3D digital model onto which we could produce the reconstruction. The reconstruction process is carried out utilizing specialist computer equipment which allows the user to \u2018feel\u2019 what they are modeling on screen. The anatomy of the face is modeled in \u2018virtual clay\u2019 from the deep muscles to the superficial.\u201d\nErolin\u2019s colleague Janice Aitken then made the reconstruction even more realistic by adding facial features and coloring. \u201cI use the same sort of software as is used to create 3D animations in the film industry,\u201d she explained. \u201cI digitally created realistic eyes, hair and bonnet and added lighting to create a natural look.\u201d\nFor Sarah Maltby, director of attractions for the York Archaeological Trust, the reconstruction project demonstrates how advanced archaeological research capabilities have become since the original Coppergate excavations took place more than three decades ago. \u201cWe now have a much more accurate and physical image of what Viking life was like, what they ate, what they wore and even what they looked like thanks to Dundee University\u2013all of which is now on display at Jorvik,\u201d she said.\nFor more information, check out the press release issued by the University of Dundee or visit the website of the Jorvik Viking Centre.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"What Did the Vikings Look Like?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/viking-reconstruction-face-150x150.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/what-did-the-vikings-look-like"}
