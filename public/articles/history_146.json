Little Elizabeth had been fine just days before when she returned home with a neighbor, Goodwife Ayres. The distraught parents, grasping at any explanation for their loss, saw the hand of the devil at work.\nThe parents were convinced that Elizabeth had been fatally possessed by Goody Ayres. The Kellys testified that their daughter first took ill the night after she returned home with her neighbor, and that she exclaimed, \u201cFather! Father! Help me, help me! Goodwife Ayres is upon me. She chokes me. She kneels on my belly. She will break my bowels. She pinches me. She will make me black and blue.\u201d\nAfter Elizabeth\u2019s death, accusations of bewitchment flew, and fingers were pointed at numerous townspeople. Hysteria gripped Hartford, a town that a generation before had witnessed the first execution of a suspected witch in the American colonies. Alse (Alice) Young of Windsor, Connecticut, was sent to the gallows erected in Hartford\u2019s Meeting House Square, now the site of Connecticut\u2019s Old State House, on May 26, 1647.\nWitchcraft was one of 12 capital crimes decreed by Connecticut\u2019s colonial government in 1642. The legal precedent cited by the devoutly Puritan colonists was of a divinely higher order: biblical passages such as Exodus 22:18 (\u201cThou shalt not suffer a witch to live\u201d) and Leviticus 20:27 (\u201cA man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death\u201d).\nAfter Young\u2019s public hanging, at least five other Connecticut residents met a similar fate. However, it was in Hartford in 1662, 30 years before the infamous Salem witch trials, that a witch hunt hysteria took hold, resulting in seven trials and four executions.\nShortly after Elizabeth Kelly\u2019s death, the pious Ann Cole suddenly became \u201cafflicted,\u201d shaking violently and spouting blasphemy. According to one contemporary account, Cole was \u201ctaken with strange fits, wherein she (or rather the devil, as \u2018tis judged, making use of her lips) held a discourse for a considerable time.\u201d Cole blamed her bewitchment on neighbor Rebecca Greensmith, described by one townsperson as \u201ca lewd, ignorant, considerably aged woman,\u201d and others already suspected of witchcraft in the Kelly case. The accused began to accuse others, and even their spouses, of being the true witches. In what became a vicious circle, neighbors began testifying against neighbors. Goody Ayres\u2019 husband, perhaps in an attempt to save his wife, joined in the chorus of Greensmith\u2019s accusers.\nThe most damning testimony supposedly came from Greensmith herself, who reportedly admitted to having \u201cfamiliarity with the devil\u201d and said that \u201cat Christmas they would have a merry meeting\u201d to form a covenant. Greensmith implicated her husband and said she had met in the woods with seven other witches, including Goody Ayres, Mary Sanford and Elizabeth Seager. Neighbors testified that they saw Seager dancing with other women in the woods and cooking mysterious concoctions in black kettles.\nTwo of the suspects, likely the Greensmiths, were subjected to the swimming test in which their hands and feet were bound and they were cast into the water to test the theory that witches are unable to sink. After they were tried, the Greensmiths were indicted \u201cfor not having the fear of God before thine eyes; thou hast entertained familiarity with Satan the grand enemy of God and mankind and by his help hast acted things in a preternatural way.\u201d The court\u2019s verdict: \u201cAccording to the law of God and the established law of this commonwealth, thou deserves to die.\u201d\nRebecca Greensmith had confessed in open court. Nathaniel Greensmith had protested his innocence. But they both met the same fate: the noose. Sanford was also sent to the gallows. After their executions, Cole reportedly was \u201crestored to health.\u201d Ayres fled Hartford, while Seager was finally convicted of witchcraft in 1665, although the governor reversed the verdict the following year. Mary Barnes of Farmington, Connecticut, was also swept up in the region\u2019s witch hunt and executed alongside the Greensmiths.\nThe four executions of suspected witches in Hartford were to be Connecticut\u2019s last. Another hysteria broke out in Fairfield, Connecticut, in 1692, but none of those convicted met death. Connecticut held its final witch trial in 1697, a half century after Alse Young\u2019s execution. During that period, there were 46 prosecutions and at least 11 executions.\nDescendants of some of those 11 colonists are seeking posthumous pardons and apologies similar to those that occurred in Massachusetts for victims of the Salem witch trials. Previous resolutions in the Connecticut legislature, however, have not come out of committee, and the state\u2019s Board of Pardons and Paroles also has a policy of not granting posthumous pardons. The descendants are now pressing for a gubernatorial proclamation to clear the names of their ancestors.","author":"Christopher  Klein","web_category":"news","title":"Before Salem, the First American Witch Hunt","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/witch-trial.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/before-salem-the-first-american-witch-hunt"}
