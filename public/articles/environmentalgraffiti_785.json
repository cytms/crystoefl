Although, it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, and some people\u2019s idea of purgatory. So, if you\u2019re of the latter persuasion then spare a few strands of sympathy for the latest slave to the mill \u2013 yes, you\u2019ve guessed it \u2026 the simple shrimp. \nTwo marine biologists \u2013 Prof David Scholnick of the Pacific University of Oregon and Lou Burnett of Grice Marine Laboratory at the College of Charleston \u2013 built an underwater treadmill as part of a research project investigating how bacterial infection may affects a shrimp\u2019s endurance. They had no idea whether shrimp would actually run on it, though, so they were both surprised and delighted when the little critters hopped on the mini treadmill and started working out.\n\u201cWe thought they would pedal along, swim and walk for a few minutes, and [instead] just hours and hours went by,\u201d said Scholnick. \u201cWe just stopped the experiment because they\u2019d just go on and on.\u201d Some were still going strong after more than four hours.\nThe poor things probably thought they were lunch and were just trying to make a run for it!\nA video of the athletic shrimp is now doing the rounds on the internet, with various inspiring tunes from films like Chariots of Fire and Rocky.\n*NB: the shrimp in the video were bred for research so have not been taken from the wild.\nSource 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
