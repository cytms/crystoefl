The area, which covers just 215 square feet, encompasses at least 10 nests that contain as many as 34 tightly packed eggs, many with embryos still inside, they reported. Additional nests probably lie within the cliff that borders the excavation zone, waiting to be revealed by natural erosion. Dated to 190 million years ago, the hatchery predates other known dinosaur nesting sites by 100 million years.\n\u201cThis is the oldest known evidence of complex reproductive behavior in a dinosaur, including nesting site fidelity and colonial breeding,\u201d said lead researcher Robert Reisz, a professor of biology at the University of Toronto Mississauga. In other words, the dinosaurs seem to have returned repeatedly to the same hatchery\u2014thought to have been conveniently located near a water source and foliage\u2014year after year. They also assembled in groups to lay their eggs, just as some bird species do today.\nThis maternity ward-like approach to procreation offered more than just familiarity and companionship: It gave the herbivorous Massospondylus mothers, which could only rely on their muscular tails and large thumb claws for self-defense, the benefit of strength in numbers, Reisz said. \u201cNesting at the same time at a site provides added protection from predators, always a major concern for animals,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere were large predators around, as well as small crocodile-like animals and small mammals too. Groups of herbivores would be more likely to intimidate a carnivorous predator than a solitary individual.\u201d\nIn a previous study, Reisz and his colleagues revealed that Massospondylus youngsters likely received a fair share of postnatal care from their mothers and other adults. Born toothless, they had no way of feeding themselves immediately after hatching. And much like human babies, they moved around on all fours before learning to walk upright like their parents, as evidenced by the tracks they left behind at the nesting site.\nAdditional research has revealed even more information about Massospondylus moms and newborns. The various footprint sizes found at the site suggest the hatchlings doubled in size before leaving their nursery, Reisz said. And Massospondylus mothers organized their eggs into a single, tightly clustered layer, a strategy typical of incubating birds. But at 20 feet long and weighing upwards of 300 pounds, these full-grown females weren\u2019t sitting on top of eggs barely larger than golf balls.\nWhy did they obsessively gather their brood even before their babies hatched? \u201cThe likely reason for such arrangement would be for maximizing survivorship of the embryos in a nest that was then covered by either vegetation or sediment,\u201d Reisz explained. \u201cThis new discovery indicates that complex reproductive behavior appeared early in dinosaur evolution, and may have characterized the biology of most dinosaurs.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Oldest Known Dinosaur Nesting Site Was Also a Nursery","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/nesting-site-reconstruction-150x150.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/oldest-known-dinosaur-nesting-site-was-also-a-nursery"}
