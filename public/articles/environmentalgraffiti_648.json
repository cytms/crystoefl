But what about the smallest of the lot; how do they deal with the cold? We\u2019ve taken a look\u2026   \nAll animals pictured here are warm-blooded or homeothermic animals, meaning they have to keep their body temperature constant regardless of weather conditions. Sound familiar? Yes, humans are also warm-blooded, er, animals that need to don scarves, hats and gloves to maintain their body temperature of roughly 37 degrees.  \nNot fair, all for the birds!

Others like bears, dogs, deer and squirrels adapt really well to the cold, making us look enviously at their thick fur. Or give hibernation a second thought. \nSources: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
