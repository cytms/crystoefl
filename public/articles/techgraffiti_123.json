Below is an illustration of how it works:\nCapable of heating up to 3 full tanks of water, IDC envisions the panels being used primarily in developing nations as a cheap alternative to the hot water heaters, but points out that their system pays back its cost in six months, while other domestic solar systems take 10-20 years to return the initial investment.\nIn pure terms of environmental impact, IDC has an amazing product\u2013 the panel will, in each case that it replaces a hot water heater, stop the output of 0.2 tons of carbon dioxide each year, and has been designed to wear well under heavy weather.\nWith patents secured and manufacturing facilities in place, IDC is now seeking potential distributors in the UK and rest of the world. I have to say, this is an opportunity not to be missed.\nVia a press release sent to us by Emma LeeEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
