George Washington\u2019s Aggressive Nature\n\u201cHad he been born in the forests,\u201d said Gilbert Stuart, who spent hours with George Washington painting the stolid portrait made famous on the dollar bill, \u201che would have been the fiercest man among the savage tribes.\u201d\nGeorge Washington\u2019s political career was built on his performance leading American forces in the Revolutionary War, but his aggressive nature almost lost the fight for American independence before it had, in earnest, begun. In June 1776, Washington decided\u2013against his generals\u2019 advice\u2013to challenge 30,000 well-armed and well-disciplined British and Hessian soldiers with just 15,000 poorly trained Americans\u2014many of them ill\u2013in a battle for southern New York. The resulting loss put Long Island and Brooklyn in British hands for most of the rest of the war and ended in the death and capture of almost 5,000 American soldiers, making it one of the worst defeats in American history.\nThis disastrous move could have ended the general\u2019s career, but Washington learned from this tragic error that he could not win the war with aggressive maneuvers. Instead, he turned to guerrilla tactics: surprise, retreat and patience. \u201cWe should protract the war,\u201d he wrote Congress, understanding that, as a lengthy war was unpalatable to the British, time was the young nation\u2019s most powerful weapon.\nWashington\u2019s lesson in restraint would again come in to play when, soon after the war\u2019s conclusion, he refused calls to be come America\u2019s new king and when, as president, he refused to jump into a European war, despite pressure from his constituents and the press. According to Washington\u2019s political ally Gouverneur Morris, Washington\u2019s iron self-control was forged to master his own \u201ctumultuous passions.\u201d That transformation created one of our wisest presidents\u2014and helped give birth to the United States of America.\n2. Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Stage Fright\nThomas Jefferson came of age in an era when politicians made their reputations with powerful oratory. But Jefferson was a shy man who preferred small-group conversations and dinner parties to speech-making and public appearances. \u201cThe whole Time I sat with him in Congress,\u201d John Adams wrote of his political rival, \u201cI never heard him utter three sentences together.\u201d\nInstead, Jefferson\u2019s favored mode of communication was writing, and his talent with the pen was such that he was able to make up for his discomfort with public speaking. Jefferson was tasked with writing the first draft of the Declaration of Independence, because he could, as Adams later wrote, \u201cwrite ten times better than I can.\u201d His immortal words \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d became a rallying cry for the revolution, and established Jefferson\u2019s reputation, without him having to utter a single public word.\nJefferson was narrowly elected as the third president of the United States in 1800, and served quietly. Unlike his predecessors George Washington and John Adams, he presented his legislative proposals to Congress in writing rather than in person. Cabinet members gave him advice on paper, and Jefferson wrote out his responses. Historians believe Jefferson\u2019s inaugurals were the only two spoken addresses he gave in eight years in office. In his biography of Jefferson, historian Joseph Ellis calls Jefferson one of the \u201cmost secluded and publicly invisible presidents in American history.\u201d Jefferson, however, didn\u2019t allow his shyness to hold him back, and he is still remembered, and revered, as one of our most effective and wisest presidents.\n3. Grover Cleveland\u2019s Scandal\nFor his entire political life, Grover Cleveland was praised as a politician with integrity\u2014a notable achievement given the notoriously corrupt Gilded Age in which he lived. His 1884 presidential campaign slogan, \u201cPublic Office Is a Public Trust,\u201d was backed up by his years of vetoing pork barrel legislation, corrupt bills and crony contracts during his time as mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York. But during the campaign, rumors spread that Cleveland had fathered a daughter out-of-wedlock while in Buffalo, and he became the butt of a snickering rhyme on the campaign trail, \u201cMa, Ma, where\u2019s my Pa? Gone to the White House, Ha, Ha, Ha.\u201d\nWhen a friend asked Cleveland how his fellow Democrats should respond to the allegations, he telegrammed back, \u201cWHATEVER YOU DO, TELL THE TRUTH.\u201d The truth\u2014that there had been no adultery or promise of marriage, and that Cleveland had supported the mother and child despite his questionable paternity\u2014apparently sufficed. The public elected him president, and although he lost his first re-election bid, he returned to the White House in 1893, becoming the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms.\n4. Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s Poor Health\nTeddy Roosevelt was a famously robust president who lived a vigorous life: He boxed in college, was an avid hiker and hunter, wrestled Cabinet members and delivered a 90-minute campaign speech after taking a bullet to the chest during his 1912 campaign for the presidency (the bullet, blocked by a folded copy of his lengthy speech and an eyeglass case, failed to pierce his skin).\nAs a boy, however, Roosevelt was frail and sickly. He suffered from stomach upsets, headaches and frequent asthma attacks, and his family tried to ease his suffering with every cure then available: vacations; sulphur baths; the lancing of swollen lymph glands (without anesthesia); medicines such as ipecac and magnesia; mustard plasters applied to his chest; and even electrical charges. \u201cNobody seemed to think I would live,\u201d he wrote years later.\nTo encourage his recovery, Roosevelt\u2019s father built a gymnasium on the second floor of the family\u2019s home, and Teddy went to work on strength-training exercises using dumbbells, horizontal bars and a punching bag. He even took boxing lessons with an ex-prizefighter, and proved surprisingly resilient. Eventually, his health improved, his asthma became less severe and he began to dedicate himself to doing \u201cthe difficult and even dangerous thing\u201d in all of life\u2019s arenas. Vice President Roosevelt brought this energy and resolve to the White House upon the death of President William McKinley in the form of relentless trust-busting, revolutionary conservation efforts and assertive foreign policy.\n5. Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s Polio\nAt age 39, Franklin Roosevelt was stricken with polio. He had already served as U.S. senator from New York, assistant secretary of the Navy and been the Democratic nominee for the vice presidency in 1920. But now he struggled to walk without crutches, a disability he assumed would mean the end of his budding political career. Roosevelt\u2019s mother, Sara, encouraged her son to give up politics, return to her Hyde Park, New York, estate and become a gentleman farmer. His wife, Eleanor, however, pushed Franklin to get back into politics.\nRoosevelt launched his political comeback at the Democratic Convention in the summer of 1928, seven years after he lost the use of his legs. Roosevelt\u2019s trip to the podium to give the nominating speech for Al Smith was the most important walk of his life. With one arm he held a cane. With the other, he held tightly to the arm of his son Elliot. Afterward, someone asked Smith whether he\u2019d erred in giving such a prominent role at the convention to a potential rival. \u201cNo,\u201d Smith replied. \u201cHe\u2019ll be dead within a year.\u201d\nIn fact, Roosevelt lived for nearly two more decades, and came to believe his struggle with polio actually made him stronger. Eleanor called it his \u201ctrial by fire,\u201d saying Franklin\u2019s ordeal gave him more depth, and made him less arrogant, more focused and more interesting. \u201cAnyone who has gone through great suffering,\u201d she said years later, \u201cis bound to have a greater sympathy and understanding of the problems of mankind.\u201d Those traits became his trademarks, and contributed to his election as governor of New York in 1929 and president in 1933. When he died in office in the spring of 1945, he was mourned as one of America\u2019s most beloved presidents.","author":"Dennis  Gaffney","web_category":"news","title":"Five Presidents\u2019 Rocky Roads to the White House","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/HITH_gafney.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/five-presidents-rocky-roads-to-the-white-house"}
