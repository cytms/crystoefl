What about being eccentric and mind blowing? The chair above was designed by Fabio Novembre. Who wouldn't want a chair shaped like a woman's bum?

This is definitely ergonomic and environmentally friendly. It can be made of recycled paper that otherwise may not be used for other things. The Cabbage Chair comes in many wonderful colors.

The wood is Wisteria and the chair is aptly named Azelea Wood Chair. Photo: Via WebUrbanist Photo: Via WebUrbanist\nThe above chair is called the Conflict. It is humorous and sarcastically witty and that's why I love it. Created by Aviad Gil, it is molded from olive wood. One can sit down on either side, but not on both at the same time. This creates a forceful compromise. \nWant sensuality and a chair that reflects your warm, harmonious soul? Check out the chairs below.
