The drive did have one thing going for it: it ran on DOS, which records all of the data in a single block, as opposed to scattering it like most modern operating systems. This meant that damage incurred to the disc was negligible: the main bulk of it was on areas of the disc that hadn't yet been recorded.\nThe disc, which was subsequently cleaned and installed onto another drive, retrieved 99 percent of the data, and allowed the experiment recorded on it to be published in a scientific journal.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
