Drained by a massive irrigation project and further devastated by drought and pollution, the inland sea's ecosystem has collapsed \u2014 the equivalent of species extinction, the study concludes.The rest of the ecosystem threat categories mirror those for species: critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable and least concern.\n?\nNorth American ecosystems appearing in the case studies included Alaska's giant kelp forests; the Great Lakes' rare Alvar beaches, a legacy of glaciers grinding across the landscape; and Caribbean coral reefs.\n?\nThe IUCN group that developed the Red List of Ecosystems criteria plans to formally propose the framework to IUCN leadership this year. Funding is in place for listing ecosystems in the Americas, and the organization hopes to have a global list in place by 2025.\n?\nDevelopment of ecosystem and species Green Lists are also underway \u2014 the carrot to the Red Lists' stick \u2014 to help the IUCN promote conservation by rewarding successes.\n?\nHere are the 20 case studies published today, from most to least endangered, with the ecosystem type noted if available.\n\nAral Sea \u2014 Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan: freshwater, collapsed\n\n\nRaised bogs \u2014 Germany: critically endangered\n\n\nGonakier forests \u2014 Senegal River floodplain: freshwater, critically endangered\n\n\nCape Sand Flats \u2014 Fynbos, South Africa: terrestrial, critically endangered\n\n\nCoorong lagoons \u2014 Australia: freshwater/marine, critically endangered\n\n\nKarst rising springs \u2014 Southern Australia: freshwater, critically endangered\n\n\nCoastal sandstone upland swamps \u2014 Australia: freshwater, endangered/critically endangered\n\n\nSwamps, marshes and lakes in the Murray-Darling Basin \u2014 Australia: freshwater, endangered/critically endangered\n\n\nGiant kelp forests \u2014 Alaska: marine, endangered/critically endangered\n\n\nCaribbean coral reefs \u2014 Caribbean: marine, endangered/critically endangered\n\n\nSeagrass meadows \u2014 Southern Australia: marine, endangered-critically endangered\n\n\nGerman tamarisk pioneer vegetation \u2014 Europe: freshwater, endangered\n\n\nCoolibah-Black Box woodland \u2014 Australia: freshwater/terrestrial, endangered\n\n\nTapia forest \u2014 Madagascar: terrestrial, endangered\n\n\nSemi-evergreen vine thicket \u2014 Australia: terrestrial, endangered\n\n\nGreat Lakes Alvars \u2014 United States and Canada: terrestrial, vulnerable/endangered\n\n\nReed beds \u2014 Europe: freshwater, vulnerable\n\n\nFloodplain ecosystem of river red gum and black box \u2014 southeastern Australia: freshwater, vulnerable\n\n\nTepui shrubland - Venezuela: terrestrial, least concern\n\n\nGranite gravel fields and sand plains - New Zealand: terrestrial, least concern\n\n?\nEmail Becky Oskin or follow her @beckyoskin.
