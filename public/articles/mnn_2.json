It\u2019s possible for everyone to live in harmony, but it\u2019s going to take a little work from the humans in the equation.?Densely populated regions across North America are taking steps to protect both bears and people.?\n?\nWhy the heck are bears so into human communities anyway? Don\u2019t they have bear-like things to do in the wild? Well, \u201cthe wild\u201d is shrinking; habitat is being eaten at an alarming rate each year as a result of commercial, residential and agricultural development. That puts pressure on bears to find new places to live, and to seek out new food sources because their natural supplies of fish, berries and plants are dwindling.\n?\nHuman communities offer something bears want, especially in August and September, when they\u2019re preparing for a long hibernation: food. Most neighborhoods, as well as campsites, are like an all-you-can-eat buffet, open 24 hours a day for any bear enterprising enough to take a little stroll and see what\u2019s available. Once bears learn that a neighborhood has one or more food sources, they\u2019ll be back again and again.\n?\nIf a community doesn\u2019t have any food, bears might pass through, but they\u2019re unlikely to cause any damage. They\u2019re naturally pretty shy, and don\u2019t want to deal with humans if they can avoid it, although they may lash out if they\u2019re diseased, feel threatened, or think they need to protect cubs. By keeping a community\u2019s food supplies locked up, which involves working with everyone who lives there, it\u2019s possible to encourage bears to move on to greener pastures \u2014 and to stay wild.\n?\nFor starters, no loose food should be stored outside. All pet and livestock feed should be kept in bearproof containers in secured areas like locked sheds, and if animals are fed outside, they should be fed only enough to supply their needs for a meal. Better yet, feed pets and livestock when they\u2019re tucked indoors for the night, and make sure homes, stables and similar structures are secured. If you feed birds, keep the feeders at least 20 feet off the ground and four to six feet away from tree trunks to make them hard to reach.\n?\nIf you\u2019re a gardener, you\u2019ll want to take some extra steps to avoid feeding the bears with your hard-grown produce! Harvest fruits and veggies as soon as they ripen, and keep your compost in a tightly secured area. Consider adding lime to cut down on food smells. You may want to consider an electric fence to keep bears out of orchards, gardens and other areas, and that goes double for bee hives, which bears?adore.?Remember Winnie the Pooh? Yeah, it\u2019s less cute when it\u2019s an actual black bear homing in for a snack.\n?\nFor even better bear control when it comes to compost, consider composting grass and plant clippings outdoors, and using a?vermicomposting?system in the kitchen or a secure shed. You can compost food waste there and add it to the soil when it\u2019s mature, all while keeping it away from the sharp noses of ursine visitors. Either way, do not add animal products like bones to the compost, as these can be bear attractants even after the compost has broken down.\n?\nYou\u2019re going to need to get your neighbors on board with this plan so that when bears pop by for a round of shopping, they\u2019ll find that all the stores are closed. If some of your neighbors can\u2019t afford bearproof containers and other safety measures, consider creating a community fund or applying for assistance from government agencies. Make sure that everyone, including children, is educated about keeping food products out of range of bears.\n?\nAnd when bears do show up, make it clear that they need to move along. If you see a bear in the street or your yard and you can?safely?do so, make some noise. Clatter pan lids, use a wooden spoon on a pot, or use a bullhorn to startle the bear and encourage it to get out of the neighborhood. Do this from the safety of your home, but before you do, check to make sure no one\u2019s out in the street; a neighbor could be harmed if the bear startles.\n?\nIf you notice a recurring visitor or a bear won\u2019t leave, call your local division of wildlife services and ask for assistance. They can monitor the bear and remove it, if necessary, relocating it to a safer location where it can live out its natural life in conditions more appropriate for wildlife. Be aware that the longer bears have to get accustomed to living around humans, the harder it can be for them to return to the wild.\n?\nAnd, we hope it goes without saying: Don\u2019t feed the bears!\n?\ns.e. smith originally wrote?this story?for Networx.com.
