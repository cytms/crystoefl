His new series, called \u2018X day projects\u2019, aims to create furniture from the mound of discarded papers without using other materials to stick them together, such as screws, nails, or glue.\nPhoto: Image: Xavier Renauld\nThe first of the series to be released is the logically named '334', after the number of newspapers used in its creation. Shown above, it took only three pieces of metal to give the bench its shape and enough strength to support five people. And what\u2019s more, the designer claims it only cost him about ¢G5 to make. Bonus.\nFor price, simplicity and novelty factor, Oscar\u2019s creation seems well worth the money. Just remember to keep it out of the rain!\nSource: Oscar Lhermitte \nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
