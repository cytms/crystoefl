Specialists note, that they have very little information on what the impacts of climate change are to oceanic life and have no doubt that research about underwater ecosystems lacks resources.\nFew investigations have launched mainly because studying life hundreds of meters below water is extremely expensive and resource intensive. Nonetheless, statistics show fewer marine systems affected than ecosystems on land. The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Changes (IPCC) reported in 2007 that around 28,500 biological changes in land systems and just 85 in marine systems. Was this just due to the lack of data?\nMaybe. Data on marine environments acquired by the IPCC over a period of 20 years was not incredibly satisfying - there have been repeated funding cuts and therefore incomplete or insufficient information has passed through.\nResearchers argue that marine life may be more exposed to climate change than ecosystems on land, as more marine organisms are moving towards the cool waters of the poles.Sources: 1, 2, 3\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
