Killing even big predators like crocodiles through its poison and laying up to 30,000 eggs in one go, the cane toad is a force to reckon with. But there\u2019s hope, yet, in the form of a surprise weapon: small is the new big with tiny Australian meat ants bringing down the mighty cane toad.\nHere\u2019s a short video of meat ants attacking and even toppling a cane toad baby:\nOnly about 100 Venezuelan cane toads (Bufo marinus) were introduced to Australia in 1935 to combat sugar cane beetles. The clever animals, however, avoided the beetles and went for everything else instead as they eat two and a half times their own body weight on average. Though there are plenty of natural predators in Australia that consider the cane toad a good meal, the toad usually has the last laugh: Even when big predators like crocodiles eat the frog, they die because of the cane toad\u2019s poison stored in its glands.\nNot recommended \u2013 croc eating poisonous cane toad:Photo: \nImage via new scientist\nCute yet extremely poisonous:Photo: \nImage: Jen 64\nThis poison coupled with the fact that females lay up to 30,000 eggs in a single clutch has led to a cane toad invasion, with their current population estimated at 200 million! This is having a devastating effect on Australian animal life as cane toads are changing the balance of the ecosystem in Northern Australia. But now there\u2019s a newly discovered and unlikely enemy that might bring down the mighty cane toad: the Australian meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus).\nMeat ants united while devouring their kill:Photo: \nImage via ntnews\nAs the name partly suggests, these tiny insects \u2013 yet giants among ants \u2013 are omnivorous scavengers and have been used by farmers to clean carcasses in the past. Recently, it was discovered that meat ants are not affected by the cane toad\u2019s poison and, in fact, have killed millions of cane toads already.\nSmall yet forceful \u2013 here protecting leafhopper nymphs whose sap they love: Photo: \nImage: Fir0002\nA group of researchers from the University of Sydney devised a clever way of instigating the ants\u2019 natural predatory instinct further to speed up the process: They put a little bit of cat food next to areas where toadlets come out of the pond. The meat ants soon discovered the cat food and considered it a delicacy. From there, it was just a small step for them to discover the baby cane toads \u2013 still much bigger than them at about 1 cm but nevertheless snack size, and nothing a committed group of meat ants couldn\u2019t tackle with a bit of team work.\nMeat ants not giving the cane toadlet a chance:Photo: \nImage via dropit2\nMeat ants devouring a cicada:Photo: \nImage: John O\u2019Neill\nSays Rick Shine, lead researcher from the University of Sydney, about the attack of the meat ants and therefore the success of the project:\n\n\nGet me out of here!Photo: \nImage via dropit2\nSkeptics were quick to point out that local wildlife may be negatively affected by attracting so many meat ants at once but the researchers have thought about this as well. Native frogs, for example, have evolved with meat ants and know how to avoid them. For one, they hop away much faster and further upon contact with the meat ants, whereas the cane toad, relying on its poison, remains still, hoping for the ants to die. Explains Shine:\n\n\nSkeptics may get convinced by considering the alternatives: killing cane toads through human efforts. If you\u2019ve heard of Ghost Busters, you can imagine what Toad Busters might do. In Northern Australia, that means a committed group of citizens who sacrifice their weekends for gassing cane toads to slow down their population.
