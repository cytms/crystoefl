A relatively new addition to the online genealogy landscape, findmypast.com has conducted similar studies of high-profile individuals in recent months. For instance, research on family ties between celebrities and Queen Elizabeth revealed that the American actress Hilary Duff is the British monarch\u2019s 15th cousin, said Joshua Taylor, the site\u2019s lead genealogist. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at ways to dive into some of the records and connect them to moments in history and add interpretation to what you might read in a history textbook,\u201d he explained.\nFindmypast.com released its latest findings just in time for the Halloween season, but it was actually a personal link rather than holiday spirit that sent Taylor rifling through the Borden records. While exploring the far reaches of his own family tree, he came across an intriguing branch that happened to include Thomas Cornell, a Rhode Island man who on May 23, 1673, hanged for the murder of his mother, Rebecca. He then discovered that the infamous Lizzie Borden was a direct descendant\u2014a fifth great-granddaughter, to be exact\u2014of the accused killer, thought to be the first person to commit matricide in the American colonies. Borden, of course, was acquitted of the 1892 ax murders of her father and stepmother.\nBorn in England, Cornell was 46 years old and expecting his seventh child\u2014his third with his second wife, Sarah\u2014when Rebecca was found burned to death in the house the family shared on February 2, 1673. The middle-aged father reportedly had a strained relationship with many fellow inhabitants of Acquidneck Island, Rhode Island, including his mother, then 73. But during his trial several months later, it wasn\u2019t just testimony about his character that sent Cornell to the gallows. Rebecca\u2019s brother John Briggs took the stand to describe a dream in which his sister revealed from the grave that her death was far from accidental.\nAfter his execution, Thomas Cornell\u2019s wife gave birth to a daughter, whom she named Innocent. The child would grow up to wed Richard Borden, a director ancestor of Lizzie\u2019s ill-fated father, Andrew. \u201cThe links between the two are kind of eerie,\u201d said Taylor, who used birth, marriage, death, census and land records to establish kinship between the families. He pointed out that, while Lizzie was acquitted and Thomas was convicted, both cases remain clouded in doubt. And in both Acquidneck Island and Lizzie Borden\u2019s hometown of Fall River, Massachusetts, the entire population became deeply involved in the trials. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting when you see an entire community integrating themselves into the event,\u201d Taylor said.\nTaylor is not the first to uncover the link between the two accused killers, which historians and amateur genealogists alike have noted in the past. Still, few people in the general public know about the skeletons in the Borden family closet or the odd tale of Thomas Cornell. In her 2002 book \u201cKilled Strangely: The Death of Rebecca Cornell,\u201d Elaine Foreman Crane connects the two crimes to yet another unsolved case involving a member of the extended family\u2014Sarah Marie Cornell, whose corpse was found hanging in a Rhode Island town in 1832. A minister was later tried for her murder and acquitted. A young mill worker, Cornell lived in Fall River, where Andrew and Abby Borden would die in a bloodbath 60 years later.\nAnother of Thomas Cornell\u2019s descendants, Ezra, left behind a more respectable legacy by donating the original endowment for Cornell University, Taylor pointed out. To this day, many members of the extended Cornell-Borden family\u2014like Taylor himself\u2014live across the United States, he noted. \u201cLizzie Borden has a lot of cousins,\u201d he said.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Family Tradition: Did Lizzie Borden\u2019s Ancestor Kill His Mother Too?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lizzie-borden-hatchet.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/family-tradition-did-lizzie-bordens-ancestor-kill-his-mother-too-2"}
