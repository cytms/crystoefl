The eastern grey whale population, however, is one of the few that is believed to have fully recovered from its pre-whaling numbers. In 1994 the whales were even removed from the U.S. list of endangered and threatened species. Scientists don't know, however, when exactly the population declined.\nElizabeth Alter, a doctoral biology student at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California said \"Our results suggest that rather than looking at this historical carrying capacity as the cause behind these die-offs, we might be better off looking at the changing conditions on the grey whale feeding ground that we know are occurring.\"\nThe Pacific Ocean used to be able to accommodate many more whales than today, leading scientists to search for other causes, such as global warming.\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Let\u2019s all go for a grey whale hunt\u2026or not.","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/wolf_1.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/let\u2019s-all-go-for-a-grey-whale-hunt\u2026or-not/285"}
