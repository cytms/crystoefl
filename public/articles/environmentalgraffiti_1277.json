In fact, India Shining was the political slogan with which India started the first decade of the new millennium. Without doubt, it has always been a country of colours so, inspired by last week\u2019s article on rainbows, we\u2019ve arranged stunning pictures of Indian moodscapes according to the rainbow spectrum. Put on some A.R. Rahman, Cat Stevens/Yusuf Islam or even Lucky Ali and follow us on an Indian tour de rang\u2026\nMany see red when they think of Mumbai\u2019s prestigious but costly Bandra-Worli sealink project:Photo: \nImage: IM Swaminathan\nA tree outlined in front of a dark orange sky on National Highway 47 near Trivandrum:Photo: \nImage: Shamih\nOne of Mumbai\u2019s most recognizable landmarks is the Haji Ali mosque and tomb between Worli and the southern part of town. Built in 1431, the days of this mosque may be numbered as its structure has been eroded beyond repair by the force of Arabian Sea over the centuries. Plans exist to tear it down and rebuild it with the same marble that has served the Taj Mahal in Agra so well. Currently, up to 40,000 people of all faiths visit the mosque on Thursdays and Fridays. According to legend, Haji Ali, a wealthy merchant, drowned at this spot while on a pilgrimage to Mecca. In any case, it is a place of inspiration for many that has hardly been captured as beautifully as in the following picture. \nMumbai\u2019s famous Haji Ali mosque in the Arabian Sea tinted yellow in front of a bright orange sky:Photo: \nImage: Humayunn N A Peerzaada\nFrom light orange to yellow - palm trees in the setting sun in Kerala: Photo: \nImage: Hannah & Noah\nTeen Minar (three towers) at the Elgandal Fort, 10 km from Karimnagar in Andhra Pradesh, bathed in green light: Photo: \nImage: Naveen Gujje\nPainted green \u2013 pigeons, those universal creatures, gather near the Taj Mahal hotel in South Mumbai:Photo: \nImage: IM Swaminathan\nPerfect blues \u2013 sunrise in Goa:Photo: \nImage: Salvatore Barbera\nThe next picture is not taken at a temple but at a private house in Cochin.

Construction of the 26m-high (85 ft) basalt arch started in 1911 and was completed in 1924. Built on reclaimed land at the southern tip of the island that is Mumbai, it used to be the first sight that hopeful visitors arriving by boat would spot.  \nPerfect indigo \u2013 pigeons flying over Mumbai\u2019s Gateway of India monument: Photo: \nImage: IM Swaminathan\nHyderabad\u2019s NTR gardens bathed in a violet sunset:  Photo: \nImage: Pranav\nA powerful display of colours - sunset over Leh in Jammu and Kashmir: Photo: \nImage: Karunakar Rayker\nMix all colours and you will get grey, even in a colourful melting pot like Mumbai... \nGrey skies over Mumbai before the onset of the monsoon:Photo: \nImage: Elroy Serrao\nA corner shop in Chennai bathed in a mysterious light: Photo: \nImage: Etienne Cazin\nThe Qutb Minar (\u201caxis minaret\u201d) in New Delhi is the world\u2019s tallest free-standing brick minaret at 72 m (238 ft). Built between 1193 and 1386, Qutb Minar is one of the earliest examples of Indo-Islamic architecture. The whole Qutb complex is a UNESCO world heritage site.  \nA touch of the divine \u2013 the Qutb Minar in New Delhi: Photo: \nImage: bbjee\nIndia Shining, a slogan popularised by the then ruling Baratya Janata Party (BJP) for the 2004 general elections in India, referred to an overall feeling of economic optimism after a good monsoon in 2003 and the Indian IT boom in 2004. Satirised as India Shining \u2013 Bharat Drowning (Bharat being the Hindi name for India), we hope that in view of the nearing monsoon and the ongoing elections, this will not be the case\u2026   \nSource: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
