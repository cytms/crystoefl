Pioneers in the burgeoning world of personal computers, the pair worked out of Jobs\u2019 parents\u2019 garage in Los Altos, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Jobs, a college dropout, became one of the great innovators of the digital age, transforming not just his original field but also music, animation and mobile communications. He died at 56 on October 5, 2011, after a long struggle with cancer. Apple\u2019s notable products include the Macintosh computer line, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, iTunes, the Mac OS X operating system and Final Cut Studio.\nConsidered the first American technology business to launch behind a garage door, Hewlett-Packard was founded in 1939 by Bill Hewlett and David Packard, who had scraped together an initial capital investment of $538. At the time, Packard and his new wife Lucile lived in an apartment next door and Hewlett camped out in a shed on the property, located in Palo Alto, California. After developing a range of electronic products, the company entered the computer market in 1966 and is now one of the world\u2019s largest technology corporations. The one-car garage where it all began is a designated California historic landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn 1923, the Missouri-born cartoonist Walt Disney moved to Los Angeles with his brother Roy to make short films that combined animation and live action. They spent several months producing their first series, the \u201cAlice Comedies,\u201d out of their uncle Robert\u2019s garage before relocating to the back of a realty office and finally to a studio. Now the world\u2019s largest media conglomerate, the Walt Disney Company became a leader in film, television, travel, leisure, music and publishing. In 2006, it acquired Pixar Studios from another veteran of a California garage: Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer. Robert Disney\u2019s garage was saved from demolition in 1984 and donated to the Stanley Ranch Museum.\nWhen Ruth and Elliot Handler, who had met in an industrial design course, started making picture frames in their California garage, they probably never thought their venture\u2014Mattel\u2014would grow into the world\u2019s biggest toy manufacturer. More or less by accident, they wound up crafting dollhouse furniture and later children\u2019s playthings out of spare wood scraps. In the late 1950s, Ruth determined there was a market for dolls that looked like \u201cgrown-ups\u201d; ignoring her husband\u2019s objections, she designed a prototype and named it after their daughter, Barbie. (Ken, named for their son, followed soon after.) Mattel struck gold with the new line, and in 1968 Ruth became the company\u2019s president.\nLong after Hewlett-Packard and Apple Computer made their unpretentious debuts, another technology powerhouse came screeching out of a Silicon Valley garage. After developing a groundbreaking search engine for a research project, Stanford University students Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in a garage owned by Susan Wojcicki, a friend and future employee. The company, which has since branched out into numerous other areas, now runs the most visited websites on the Internet and boasts locations around the world. In 2006, Google bought Wojcicki\u2019s house\u2014and the garage where its vast empire began.\nIn 1969, 17-year-old Michael Kittredge of South Hadley, Massachusetts, couldn\u2019t dig up enough cash to buy his mother a Christmas present. On a whim, he melted down some crayons in his parents\u2019 garage and made her a scented candle. When neighbors began expressing interest, Kittredge, who needed a hobby since his rock band had just broken up, recruited some friends and began churning out candles. By the following year, the booming business had taken over the Kittredge home, so the young entrepreneurs moved into a dilapidated mill. Today, the Yankee Candle Company is the leading U.S. candle manufacturer, with hundreds of retail locations, international distribution and multiple product lines.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Great American Garage Entrepreneurs","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/apple-garage.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/great-american-garage-entrepreneurs"}
