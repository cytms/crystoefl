As this season's festivities wind down, we thought we'd bring you a more unconventional (though no less spectacular) take on lighting to help you beat the winter doldrums: photos that feature bolts of light that breathe a kind of temporary, eerie life into old machinery, junk cars, abandoned warehouses and deserted streets. It's pretty cool what you can do with a camera, a few lights and a creative mind.\nLight graffiti is easy to do and commonly results in striking, colourful images. All you need is a camera and whatever light source you can get your hands on. Flashlights, blinking LEDs, fireworks, bike lights, glowsticks are all easy to find.

It can be much longer; the length of time simply depends on the desired effect, and lighting conditions at the time.

Check out the ghostly outlines of the 'light graffiti artists' in these previous images. Makes for extra creepy shots.\nThe bright lights make it seem like this abandoned warehouse is alive with activity.Photo: \nMany light graffiti artists have to practice their time-lapse techniques a few times before they can get an image they\u2019re happy with, but those who do it say it doesn\u2019t take too long to get the hang of. It also gives graffiti artists a new \u2018virtual\u2019 canvas and the ability to tag in ways they wouldn\u2019t normally be able to with a spray can.\nThere could almost be some sort of battle between several light-wielding opponents going on here.Photo: \nA late night stroll: an empty pathway and deserted bridge are lit up by the traveling lights.Photo: \nAnd the best bit about this type of graffiti? It leaves no trace on the environment at all. The only trace you\u2019ll see is the one captured on camera.
