To ease the transition, the two leagues planned a series of season-ending title games between their respective champions. Like baseball\u2019s World Series, the event would bring the best players from both organizations onto the same field.\nWhen it came time to choose a name for the contest, Hunt made history once again. Meeting to plan the inaugural game in the summer of 1966, Hunt and other football kingpins ironed out the details but couldn\u2019t nail down a catchy moniker. Officially, the event would be known as the \u201cFirst AFL-NFL World Championship Game,\u201d but its organizers referred to it as the \u201cfinal game,\u201d the \u201cchampionship game\u201d and other iterations that never quite caught on.\nDuring one of these meeting, Hunt blurted out an alternative with staying power: the \u201cSuper Bowl.\u201d He soon admitted that his two children\u2019s latest obsession, an ultra-bouncy orb called the \u201cSuper Ball,\u201d had likely inspired his flash of brilliance. (The world \u201cbowl\u201d was already in use for college football championships at the time.) Other members of the planning committee began tossing the name around, and before long the media picked up on it.\nThe Hunt kids\u2019 beloved Super Ball was the brainchild of chemist Norman Stingley, who developed it as a side project while working for a California rubber company in the early 1960s. He discovered that highly pressurized synthetic rubber had remarkable bounce when shaped into a sphere. Stingley\u2019s employer passed on the innovation, but toy manufacturer Wham-O\u2014maker of the Hula Hoop and Frisbee\u2014understood its appeal and bought the concept. By the summer of 1965 the Super Ball was one of America\u2019s most popular playthings.\nThough fans quickly adopted the \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d title, it had its detractors\u2014including Pete Rozelle, commissioner of the NFL. According to the 2002 memoirs of Super Bowl founding father Don Weiss, entitled \u201cThe Making of the Super Bowl,\u201d Rozelle hated the word \u201csuper,\u201d which he considered too colloquial. So in mid-1969, a contest was held to rebrand the championship under a new label. None of the submissions\u2014Weiss mentions \u201cUltimate Bowl\u201d and \u201cPremier Bowl\u201d as the best of the bunch\u2014won over the judges.\nEven Hunt himself felt lukewarm about the term he coined. \u201cI guess it is a little corny, but it looks like we\u2019re stuck with it,\u201d he told an AP reporter in January 1970. After describing the connection to his children\u2019s bouncy ball, he said, \u201cKinda silly, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not proud of it. But nobody\u2019s come up with anything better.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Super Bowl Owes Its Name to a Bouncy Ball","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/super-bowl-name.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/super-bowl-owes-its-name-to-a-bouncy-ball"}
