So why not skip that part altogether and buy a pet that will outlive your grandchildren! These five critters all have average lifespans longer than your average bear, or human, as the case might be.\nPhoto: Dan Hershman\nThis saltwater species has a life span of a minimum 160 years (when they are not being turned into sashimi). They have a noticeable 1m long neck when out of their shell.\nTuataras (shown top)\nThe two tuatara species found alive today are considered to be living dinosaurs as they have flourished on earth for 200 million years. They are also one of the longest-living vertebrates on Earth, both as a species and as individuals. A captive Tuatara just fathered its first egg at the spy age of 111 years old! \nGiant Tortoise\nPhoto: Joachim S. M?ller's\nThis species of tortoise is currently the longest living vertebrate on Earth. One such tortoise named Harriet, a Gal?pagos tortoise, died at the age of 175 when she looked at a calendar (or at least I'm assuming, it was heart failure). 'Adwaita' another giant tortoise of Aldabra species is known to have died at the age of 250 in March 2006. \nLamellibrachia Tube Worms\nPhoto: kzelnio\nThese colorful tube worms (L. luymesi) are found in deep sea waters. They exist on the hydrocarbon vents found on the ocean floor and seem to live more than 170 years. There is no way to be sure they are as old as they seem, but rumor is they don't care for loud music or youth fashion trends.\nAntarctic sponge\nPhoto: Hannes Grobe\nDue to the extremely low temperature that prevails in Antarctic Ocean, the Antarctic sponges have an extremely slow growth rate. One specimen has been recorded to have lived for 1,550 years. This makes them the George Burns of sponges.","author":"Gregory Johansson","web_category":"nature","title":"5 Animals That Outlive Humans","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/WEB283423jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/animals/news-5-animals-live-longer-humans"}
