The horrified audience in the Milwaukee Auditorium on October 14, 1912, gasped as the former president unbuttoned his vest to reveal his bloodstained shirt. \u201cIt takes more than that to kill a bull moose,\u201d the wounded candidate assured them. He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a bullet-riddled, 50-page speech. Holding up his prepared remarks, which had two big holes blown through each page, Roosevelt continued. \u201cFortunately I had my manuscript, so you see I was going to make a long speech, and there is a bullet\u2014there is where the bullet went through\u2014and it probably saved me from it going into my heart. The bullet is in me now, so that I cannot make a very long speech, but I will try my best.\u201d\nOnly two days before, the editor-in-chief of The Outlook characterized Roosevelt as \u201can electric battery of inexhaustible energy,\u201d and for the next 90 minutes the 53-year-old former president proved it. \u201cI give you my word, I do not care a rap about being shot; not a rap,\u201d he claimed. Few could doubt him. Although his voice weakened and his breath shortened, Roosevelt glared at his nervous aides whenever they begged him to stop speaking or positioned themselves around the podium to catch him if he collapsed. Only with the speech completed did he agree to visit the hospital.\nThe shooting had occurred just after 8 p.m. as Roosevelt entered his car outside the Gilpatrick Hotel. As he stood up in the open-air automobile and waved his hat with his right hand to the crowd, a flash from a Colt revolver 5 feet away lit up the night. The candidate\u2019s stenographer quickly put the would-be assassin in a half nelson and grabbed the assailant\u2019s right wrist to prevent him from firing a second shot.\nThe well-wishing crowd morphed into a bloodthirsty pack, raining blows on the shooter and shouting, \u201cKill him!\u201d According to an eyewitness, one man was \u201cthe coolest and least excited of anyone in the frenzied mob\u201d: Roosevelt. The man who had been propelled to the Oval Office after an assassin felled President William McKinley bellowed out, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him. Bring him here. I want to see him.\u201d Roosevelt asked the shooter, \u201cWhat did you do it for?\u201d With no answer forthcoming, he said, \u201cOh, what\u2019s the use? Turn him over to the police.\u201d\nAlthough there were no outward signs of blood, the former president reached inside his heavy overcoat and felt a dime-sized bullet hole on the right side of his chest. \u201cHe pinked me,\u201d Roosevelt told a party official. He coughed into his hand three times. Not seeing any telltale blood, he determined that the bullet hadn\u2019t penetrated his lungs. An accompanying doctor naturally told the driver to head directly to the hospital, but Colonel Roosevelt gave different marching orders: \u201cYou get me to that speech.\u201d\nX-rays taken after the campaign event showed the bullet lodged against Roosevelt\u2019s fourth right rib on an upward path to his heart. Fortunately, the projectile had been slowed by his dense overcoat, steel-reinforced eyeglass case and hefty speech squeezed into his inner right jacket pocket. Roosevelt dictated a telegram to his wife that said he was \u201cin excellent shape\u201d and that the \u201ctrivial\u201d wound wasn\u2019t \u201ca particle more serious than one of the injuries any of the boys used continually to be having.\u201d\nEven before the shooting, the 1912 presidential campaign had been a raucous one, with the former Republican president challenging his party\u2019s standard-bearer (and his handpicked successor), incumbent William Howard Taft. The internecine fight, so fierce that barbed wire concealed by patriotic bunting defended the podium at the Republican Convention, tore the Grand Old Party apart. Roosevelt went rogue and ran under the banner of the Progressive Party, nicknamed the \u201cBull Moose Party.\u201d Blasted by political opponents and elements of the press for being a power-hungry traitor willing to break the tradition of two-term presidencies, Roosevelt told the Milwaukee audience that the campaign\u2019s inflamed political rhetoric contributed to the shooting. \u201cIt is a very natural thing,\u201d he said, \u201cthat weak and vicious minds should be inflamed to acts of violence by the kind of awful mendacity and abuse that have been heaped upon me for the last three months by the papers.\u201d\nThe \u201cweak\u201d mind responsible for the assassination attempt belonged to 36-year-old John Schrank, an unemployed New York City saloonkeeper who had stalked his prey around the country for weeks. A handwritten screed found in his pockets reflected the troubled thoughts of a paranoid schizophrenic. \u201cTo the people of the United States,\u201d Schrank had written. \u201cIn a dream I saw President McKinley sit up in his coffin pointing at a man in a monk\u2019s attire in whom I recognized Theodore Roosevelt. The dead president said\u2014This is my murderer\u2014avenge my death.\u201d Schrank also claimed he acted to defend the two-term tradition of American presidents. \u201cI did not intend to kill the citizen Roosevelt,\u201d the shooter said at his trial. \u201cI intended to kill Theodore Roosevelt, the third termer.\u201d Schrank pled guilty, was determined to be insane and was confined for life in a Wisconsin state asylum.\nDoctors determined it was safer to leave the bullet embedded deep in Roosevelt\u2019s chest than to operate, although the shooting exacerbated his chronic rheumatoid arthritis for the rest of his life. Even though the attempted assassination unleashed a wave of sympathy for Roosevelt, the Republican split led to an easy victory by Democrat Woodrow Wilson on Election Day. Roosevelt came in second with 27 percent of the vote, the highest percentage of any third-party candidate in American history.","author":"Christopher  Klein","web_category":"news","title":"Shot in the Chest 100 Years Ago, Teddy Roosevelt Kept on Talking","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tr-before-assassination.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/shot-in-the-chest-100-years-ago-teddy-roosevelt-kept-on-talking"}
