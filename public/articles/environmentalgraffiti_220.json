However, in a unique study, this was found to be untrue as bears actually uncouple the two systems.\nUsing nuisance black bears that had been captured, Oivind Toien and his team put them in wooden \"caves\" in the woods and implanted radio transmitters to monitor their heart beat, temperature and body activity. They noticed that the temperature fluctuated by 6 degrees (between 30 to 36 degrees) in 2- to 7-day cycles.\nPhoto: Photography by ?ivind T?ien/Institute of Arctic Biology/University of Alaska FairbanksA young male American black bear, captured in south-central Alaska as a nuisance animal, is shown having been just placed in an artificial den\nWhile their body temperature only dropped slightly, their metabolism dropped to 75% of what it normally is in summer, and their heartbeat dropped from 55 to 14 beats a minute. Another surprising finding was that their metabolism did not return to normal in spring right away but took 2 to 3 weeks to do so. \nAll of this shows a hibernation unique to a large, human-sized animal. The findings could have implications for humans and even save people's lives. \"When black bears emerge from hibernation in spring, it has been shown that they have not suffered the losses in muscle and bone mass and function that would be expected to occur in humans over such a long time of immobility and disuse,\" explained Brian Barnes, the senior author of the study.\nPhoto: ?ivind T?ien, Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska FairbanksA young male American black bear after emergence from hibernation.
