It is an oasis for the endangered species and also a boon for those dependent on fishing for their livelihood as the stock recovers.\nPhoto: ?

Known as \u201cShark Island,\u201d it is abundant with white tip reef sharks, hammerhead sharks and whale sharks, as well as leatherback turtles and more than 30 endemic (unique to the island area) marine species.\nPhoto: ?

Loggerhead turtles, meanwhile, are also endangered as a result of having their nests raided for their eggs and also through getting caught in nets. The new decree will protect the area from fishing and of course the taking of the eggs \u2013 which is vital as the Costa Rican population of turtles has declined 90% in the last 20 years.\nPhoto: ? Phil CollaWhale sharks, the largest fish in the world and holy grail to scuba divers, regularly concentrate around Cocos Island.\nScott Henderson, Regional Marine Conservation Director for Conservation International aid, said: \"Protecting threatened marine life and ensuring thriving fisheries is what our Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape Program is all about. Costa Rica and its neighbors are enormously important centers of marine diversity and abundance that underpin valuable fisheries and tourism industries. Today's announcement reconfirms Costa Rica's role as a regional leader in green economic development \u2014 extending this approach from its land to its oceans. Tomorrow's fisheries will show that the expansion of Cocos benefits fishermen, too.\"\nPhoto: ? Tony Fern?ndezYellowfin tuna is protected by Cocos National Park. This helps maintain healthy populations levels that sustain highly valuable fisheries.\nThis vitally needed new Seamounts Marine Management Area is larger than Yellowstone Park in the U.S. and second only to the Galapagos National Park in the Eastern Pacific area is size. The ocean is where the majority of biodiversity still lies and desperately needed protection is slowly making its way in to help conserve our species and help humans make their livelihoods with sustainable fishing.","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"nature","title":"An Oasis of Hope for Endangered Sharks and Sea Turtles","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Island9.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-oasis-and-hope-endangered-sharks-and-sea-turtles"}
