Enchanting, magical and beautiful are just three adjectives that might be used to describe this amazing work; unsettling and creepy are two more.\nThese multifaceted creations resemble a real live forest from some strange alien world. You do not merely gaze at the \u2018Hylozoic Series\u2019 installations of Canadian architect and artist Philip Beesley; you wander through them, you feel them, you smell them.\nImage: ?PBAI\nThese photographs are from four recent exhibitions of Beesley\u2019s hylozoic art \u2013 in Espacio (Madrid), Sibyl (Sydney), Vesica (Wellington), and Protocell Field (Rotterdam). The word \u2018hylozoic\u2019 originates from the philosophy of hylozoism, the belief that everything, from the smallest atom to the universe itself, is alive. \u201cIt suggests that life comes out of material things, and it suggests that there are no strict boundaries between the inert matter of rock, gasses and liquids, and living things,\u201d explains Beesley. \u201cAll things are potentially animate.\u201d\nImage: ?PBAI\nBeesley goes on to explain the hylozoic concept as it relates to current scientific developments. \u201cAlthough [it is] rooted in mythology, when we look at recent progress in the science of artificial life and information technology, there does seem to be an increasingly diffused line between organic and inorganic matter,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, we could say there is some evidence that the idea is coming true.\u201d Walking around his responsive, animated, interactive creations, it isn\u2019t hard to see what he means.\nImage: ?PBAI\nThese extraordinary works blur the lines between art, architecture and science, involving everything from chemistry and robotics to music and design. \u201cOur studio has invested in digital fabrication equipment that allows us to make a range of prototypes and mechanisms in mixtures of materials,\u201d says Beesley. \u201cWe also work with many specialty contractors that can handle multiple materials and custom electronics. Full-strength digital modeling tends to play a prominent role, but at the same time, traditional hand-crafts, machining, and simple rendering, drawing and writing form a core. Along with heavy data storage, we have lots of handwriting and sketching in notebooks.\u201d\nImage: ?PBAI\nSculpture? Architecture? Machinery? It\u2019s difficult to know what to call something with so many amazing and intriguing elements. Touching one of the dangling creepers sets off a vibration and causes synthetic leaves to uncurl and wave as if caught in a gentle breeze. And just moving around in some areas sets off lights and motion. The whole thing really does seem to have a life of its own, which has led some to refer to Beesley\u2019s work as \u201cliving architecture.\u201d\nImage: ?PBAI\nBeesley himself is wary of using the term \u201cliving\u201d to describe his work, substituting it with \u201cnear-living.\u201d \u201cWe need to be careful about what we claim,\u201d he cautions. \u201cSome people are calling this living architecture, and of course we enjoy being associated with such an amazing term, but I\u2019m interested in limiting the claim because \u2018life\u2019 is a very big word. This work doesn\u2019t nearly approach the complexity that naturally living systems have.\u201d Of course, in a way, biological beings are also a part of the installation, as they move through the exhibition with caution, responding with surprise, intrigue, delight and, occasionally, fright.\nImage: ?PBAI\nYou may have noticed the various glass vials and jars filled with liquid in these photographs. That\u2019s the chemistry aspect of the installations. The containers hold different substances. In some, for example, there are perfumes, which drip down through tubes.\nImage: ?PBAI\nOther of the containers are more complicated. For instance, one of the flasks holds a \u201ccarbon-capture system\u201d, mostly made up of sodium hydroxide, which sucks up carbon from the atmosphere, creating a residual carbon-based chalky deposit. Other flasks contain copper sulfate and potassium ferricyanide, which creates a coppery \u201cskin\u201d that Beesley would one day like to see branch out and cover the scaffolding. \u201cBut that makes a pretty big mess,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo we\u2019re happy to house them in glass for now.\u201d\nImage: ?PBAI\nBeesley\u2019s work has been described as a forerunner to responsive architecture. \u201cThis work is asking some basic questions,\u201d says Beesley. \u201cMight buildings come alive? Might they respond to us, and care about us? How might they take care of themselves and contribute to the environment? The answers to these questions involve much technical craft, along with some poetic speculation,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThe work could be seen as a kind of a projection of possibility for future architecture.\u201d\nImage: ?PBAI\nWhen he talks about responsive architecture, Beesley is not referring to electronic devices that simply react to stimulus. \u201cResponsiveness does not necessarily make something sensitive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe walk through a shopping mall and the doors open, don\u2019t they? We clap our hands and the light goes on. These kinds of functions are not profoundly revolutionary.\u201d\nImage: ?PBAI\n\u201cWhen I dwell on the term responsive, I do not mean a one-way responsiveness where things pick up on what we want and are more sensitive to us,\u201d Beesley elaborates. \u201cI have a hunger to find a mutual relationship with the environment in order to discover new kinds of balances for the future.\u201d\nImage: ?PBAI\nCurrently, Beesley is a professor at the University of Waterloo\u2019s School of Architecture, in Ontario, Canada. He also runs an interdisciplinary design firm in Toronto that uses his previous credentials as a housing activist and community organizer to work with community groups.\nBeesley\u2019s building designs include banks, museums and churches. And perhaps this is why his ideas about the future of architecture are so interesting: they\u2019re expressed by someone with extensive practice in the field, not just an artist with a creative imagination. We look forward to seeing more of Beesley\u2019s visions come to life in the future.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","author":"Yohani Kamarudin","web_category":"art-design","title":"The Sensory Wonders of Beesley's Synthetic Enchanted Forest","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/2012/10/HylozoicPROTOFIELD_cPBAI.jpg","url":"http://www.techgraffiti.com/artist-creates-amazing-synthetic-life-exhibit"}
