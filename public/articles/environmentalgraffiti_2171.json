They\u2019re currently working on making the cells from female bone marrow, which would be much easier and more practical than creating them from embryos.\nThe creation means that lesbian couples could soon have children that shared the DNA of both women, rather than having one male biological father. A sperm cell created from one partner could fertilize her partner\u2019s egg.\nThere is some question about whether a sperm cell created from a female could produce viable, healthy offspring.  The human female sperm cells could not in their current state produce offspring as they do not have the correct amount of genetic material. The team must next have the cells undergo meiosis to make sure the cells have the correct amount of genetic material.\nThat will likely only be a minor roadblock. Prof Nayernia has already overcome this problem with sperm cells created from male cells. In 2006, he used sperm created from embryonic stem cells to impregnate mice. The mice produced 7 pups, although one died and the other six had health problems.\nOk, so it may be overstating it a bit to say that males will be irrelevant. Just because we\u2019re not technically needed to breed doesn\u2019t mean women will no longer find men attractive, right? After all, we\u2019re good for a lot more than just baby making. We\u2019ve got tons to offer! For instance, just the other day I assembled a chair from Ikea, and it only wobbles a tiny bit when you sit on it. Also, I\u2019m frequently asked to kill insects. I think we men have a bright future.\nInfo from Telegraph\nIf you want to find out more about eggs, sperm, and all the latest scientific breakthroughs subcribe to our RSS feed?
