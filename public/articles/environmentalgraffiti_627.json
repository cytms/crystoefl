These are slogans (plus artwork) printed on condom packets to entice people to hump like animals. Just kidding: to use condoms while humping like animals. And all that to avoid human overpopulation. The idea is ingenious but we fear the thought of endangered species coupled with bad rhymes could put people off sex altogether. One way of stopping overpopulation, but at what a price!  \nSafe sex with endangered species?Photo: \nThe clever idea is the brainchild of the Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity. The Center currently has a network of 3,000 volunteers ranging from \u201cministers to grandmothers to healthcare providers to college students and biologists\u201d who hand out the condom packets at bars, concerts, local events, farmer\u2019s markets, universities and spiritual meetings in all 50 states of the US.\nThe aim is to \u201chighlight how unsustainable human population growth is driving species extinct at a cataclysmic rate.\u201d The logic is that humans, as the most populous large mammals on Earth, take up way too many resources and therefore contribute to the extinction of other species. According to the Center, humans are currently endangering 12% of mammals, 12% of birds, 31% of reptiles, 30% of amphibians and 37% of fish.   \nWe don\u2019t know about you but we\u2019d rather pull the blanket tightly over our heads upon hearing this sad news than throw the duvet off frivolously. Or, to say it in the words of the CBD: bury that tweedle, forget that jimmy and stop humping! \nVisiting EndangeredSpeciesCondoms.com might pay off though. Not only can one learn more about the six species featured and overpopulation, one can also volunteer to be an official Endangered Species Condom distributor or win free condoms for life \u2013 but it's for United States residents only.
