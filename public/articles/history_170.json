Now, more than a decade later, a dig organized by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has unearthed a giant ancient mosaic in what was once a far-flung corner of the Roman empire. Boasting an estimated 1,600 square feet of exquisitely decorated tiles, the find highlights the historical and archaeological importance of an overlooked region, experts believe.\nThe mosaic, thought to have been part of a bath complex, once lay within the provincial city of Antiochia ad Cragum, founded in the middle of the first century by the Roman client-king Antiochus IV. Until recently, historians and archaeologists did not realize how strongly Rome\u2019s influence shaped the city, which fell under Roman rule, said University of Nebraska-Lincoln art history professor Michael Hoff. He and his colleagues\u2014including students participating in a summer field school\u2014have been excavating the ancient site since 2005. Along with the mosaic and bath, they have found evidence of Roman-style temples, markets, shops and streets, Hoff said.\n\u201cThis region is not well-understood in terms of history and archaeology,\u201d Hoff explained in a video released by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \u201cEverything that we find adds more evidence to our understanding of this area of the Roman empire. We\u2019re beginning to understand that it was perhaps more Romanized, more in line with the rest of the Roman world, than had been suspected before.\u201d\nIndeed, the mosaic is typically Roman in design, featuring large squares with geometric patterns. Perhaps most strikingly, it stretches over 1,600 square feet of space. \u201cThe mosaic is spectacular because it is extremely large,\u201d Hoff said. \u201cAs far as we are aware, it looks to be the largest mosaic of its kind ever found in southern Turkey. It\u2019s also unusual in its preservation. It\u2019s extremely well-preserved.\u201d So far, Hoff and his team have uncovered an estimated 50 percent of the marble tiles. They believe that a 25-foot-long marble pool once welcomed bathers in the center of the mosaic.\n\u201cWe were surprised to have found a mosaic of such size and of such caliber in this region of Turkey, an area that had usually been off the map, off the radar screen, of most ancient historians and archaeologists,\u201d Hoff remarked. \u201cIt does cause us to change our focus about what we think Rough Cilicia\u201d\u2014the region encompassing coastal areas of southern Turkey\u2014\u201cwas like in antiquity.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Giant Roman Mosaic Unearthed in Turkey","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/roman-mosaic-turkey1.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/giant-roman-mosaic-unearthed-in-turkey"}
