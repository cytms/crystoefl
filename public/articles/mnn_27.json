The circuses were given a year to comply with the law, but many kept their animals, including a number of lions, caged in deplorable conditions.\n?\nIn 2010, with the aid of Bolivian wildlife officials, ADI stepped in.\n?\n\u201cLion Ark\u201d follows ADI\u2019s team as they track down eight illegal circuses, face off against angry circus owners and race against time to transport 25 lions to a Colorado animal sanctuary.\n?\nThe movie opens in the middle of a confrontation between rescuers and a knife-wielding circus owner, and through a series of interviews and flashbacks, viewers learn how ADI located the illegal circus in a remote Bolivian town.\n?\nOver the course of the film, rescuers track down filthy, starving lions \u2014 some living eight to a cage \u2014 and transport them 5,000 miles to freedom.\n?\nAlthough the film features appearances by Bob Barker and \"CSI\"-star Jorja Fox, the lions are the real stars of the movie \u2014 especially Colo Colo, an aggressive 12-year-old lion that\u2019s spent his entire life in the same small cage.\n?\nHe claws and snarls at rescuers, and when he\u2019s finally released into a more spacious holding cage, Colo Colo launches himself at ADI President Jan Creamer who calms him with a drink from a watering can. When the lion is finally released and walks on grass for the first time, it\u2019s one of the most poignant moments of the film.\n?\nToday, the 25 lions \u2014 many of which spent years confined to a cage by themselves \u2014 live in prides at the 320-acre The Wild Animal Sanctuary near Denver in one of the largest captive lion enclosures in the world.\n?\n\u201cLion Ark\u201d will be on the international film festival circuit in June.
