The newsflash brought the frigate\u2019s commanding officer, Captain Isaac Hull, and his charges \u201cflocking up like pigeons from a net bed,\u201d according to one crewman.\nIt was HMS Guerriere again. The same frigate that Hull had skillfully eluded a month earlier near New York by taking evasive actions that included dumping 10 tons of drinking water overboard. The same warship that had been notorious for stopping American merchant vessels at sea and impressing their sailors, a practice that partly led to the declaration of war against Great Britain on June 18, 1812.\nNow, two months later, Constitution and Guerriere, a French ship that had been captured by the Royal Navy in 1806, closed in on each other 400 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia. Constitution was the larger frigate, boasting a larger crew, a thicker hull and six more guns. What\u2019s more, it had an unblemished combat record since being launched in 1797. Even if the commander of Guerriere, Captain James Dacres, knew he was outgunned and outmanned, he was still eager for a fight, telling others on board that if he became the first British captain to capture an American vessel, he would \u201cbe made for life.\u201d The Royal Navy, after all, had a sterling record in ship-to-ship combat against more formidable opponents than the Americans.\nGuerriere opened fire but missed wildly. Constitution launched occasional shots, but Hull, to the unease of his crew, ordered them to hold most of their fire until they engaged the enemy in extremely close action. Around 6 p.m., the two ships drew alongside about 25 yards apart. Constitution rocked Guerriere with a full broadside. Hull, eager to get a better view of the action, split his dress breeches as he leapt atop an arms chest.\nTo the amazement of Dacres and his crew, the 18-pound iron cannonballs launched by Guerriere bounced harmlessly off the American frigate\u2019s 24-inch triple-layered hull, which was made of white oak and live oak sheathed in copper forged by Paul Revere. One British sailor supposedly yelled out, \u201cHuzza! Her sides are made of iron!\u201d Thus, Constitution was christened \u201cOld Ironsides.\u201d\nAfter 15 minutes of intense bombardment, the mizzenmast fell over the starboard side of the staggered Guerriere and impaired its ability to maneuver. Within minutes, Guerriere\u2019s bowsprit became entangled with Constitution\u2019s mizzen rigging, and the two interlocked ships rotated clockwise. As both ships prepared boarding parties, sharpshooters in the mast tops rained down musket fire on their enemies. Dacres was wounded in the back, and on the deck of Constitution a musket ball fatally felled Lieutenant William Bush, who became the first U.S. Marine Corps officer to die in combat.\nDuring the mayhem, the ships tore free of each other. Fifteen minutes after Guerriere\u2019s mizzenmast fell, its foremast snapped like a matchstick and carried the mainmast with it. The mighty British warship was now a crippled hulk with 30 holes smashed in its side and body parts strewn on its blood-splattered deck. Constitution sported pockmarks on its sails, but Old Glory still flapped in the wind, and its mighty hull, of course, remained intact.\nAs the Guerriere crew threw the dead overboard, Dacres ordered a shot to be fired from the leeward side in surrender. Hull, unclear of the sign in the growing darkness, dispatched a lieutenant over to the enemy ship. \u201cCommodore Hull\u2019s compliments and wishes to know if you have struck your flag,\u201d said the lieutenant. Dacres responded with dry British wit, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Our mizzenmast is gone, our mainmast is gone\u2014and upon the whole, you may say we have struck our flag.\u201d\nThe battle wasn\u2019t critical to the outcome of the war, but it was an important statement of American naval power and a boost to Yankee morale. Even without Guerriere, Constitution arrived triumphantly in Boston on August 30. Crowds thronged rooftops and wharves and exclaimed hearty cheers. The frigate had left Boston 28 days earlier as USS Constitution. It had returned as \u201cOld Ironsides,\u201d an American icon.\nTo commemorate the battle\u2019s bicentennial, this weekend the U.S. Postal Service will unveil a new commemorative stamp featuring Constitution, and the world\u2019s oldest commissioned warship will take a historic victory lap around Boston Harbor. It will be just the second time in 131 years that the frigate has sailed under its own power, and once again Bostonians will line the shores to salute Old Ironsides.","author":"Christopher  Klein","web_category":"news","title":"How USS Constitution Became \u2018Old Ironsides\u2019 200 Years Ago","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/constitution-vs-guerriere.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/how-uss-constitution-became-old-ironsides-200-years-ago"}
