More to the point, she asks them for money. In return, the corporations get the kind of cutting-edge information to help them stay one step ahead of the competition.\"\n\n?\nColbert-Busch, who will file her papers to run on Tuesday, is expected to go up against former Republican Governor Mark Sanford; who is said to be staging a comeback from the adultery scandal that rocked his office in 2009.?\n?\n\u201cI think she\u2019s a very talented person. I think she\u2019s got the ability to raise money.
