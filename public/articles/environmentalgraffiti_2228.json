The dinosaur would have measured at least 32 metres (105 feet) in length. This makes it one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered.  The name comes from the local Mapuche Indian language, and means \u201cgiant chief of the lizards\u201d.\nThe Chinese discovery, Suzhousaurus megatherioides, was discovered in the Gobi desert in 2002, but has only recently been named and closely studied.  The dinosaurs, whose name translates as \u201cgiant sloth-like lizard of Suzhou\u201d, was a plant-eating relative of the Tyrannosaurus. Therizinosaurs had long necks with tiny heads, and short tails on a very wide body. The dinosaurs lived around 125 million years ago.\nSources: National Geographic and BBC\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"science","title":"Tyrannosaurus' \"Giant Turkey\" Cousin","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb28.webshots.com-14555-2760646110104391629S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/tyrannosaurus-giant-turkey-cousin/327"}
