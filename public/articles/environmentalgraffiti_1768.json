If you\u2019re like most people, everything is dumped in the garbage and shipped to a place far away. If you\u2019re a little more ecologically minded, you\u2019ll recycle or donate everything to charity. If you\u2019re Jean Shin, you create works of art.\nPhoto: Glasscape\nJean Shin\u2019s work seeks to bring beauty to the forgotten refuse that our society is so good at producing. She describes her style as such: \u201cmy work speaks of the optimism inherent in giving new form to life\u2019s leftovers.\u201d Her piece entitled \u2018Sound Wave\u2019, a sculptured tsunami made entirely out of old, slightly melted vinyl records, is currently on display at the Museum of Art and Design in New York City.\nPhoto: Chance City\nOne of her most moving pieces is entitled, \u2018Chance City\u2019, a collection of small-scale buildings made entirely out of lost lottery tickets. It is the essence of her art: she has taken something commonly regarded as worthless and turned it into something of worth. According to her website, a whopping $21,496 was collectively spent on the lottery tickets that ended up as part of the sculpture, tickets discarded by their owners within mere seconds of knowing they hadn\u2019t won.\nPhoto: Worn Soles\nThis type of artwork highlights the sheer volume of waste our civilization mechanically churns out, without a thought nor care. While there are many artists working with discarded and forgotten materials, Jean manages to bring the items together in a way that makes us think about them in a new light. Previously, those vinyl records, lottery tickets, clothes and shoes meant something to us, and were very important in our lives. Artists like Jean Shin show us that not only are these things still of value; they are also still beautiful.\nThanks to Jean Shin for all images.\nSource 1, 2, 3\nAbout the author: Ryan was born in Virginia, and attended James Madison University, where he earned a BA in English Literature.
