They examined 19 molars from individuals belonging to two different australopithecine species: Australopithecus africanus, a possible direct ancestor of modern humans who lived 2 to 3 million years ago, and Paranthropus robustus, who lived between 2 and 1.2 million years ago. All of the specimens were found at two adjacent cave sites near Johannesburg, South Africa.\nThe researchers then used a cutting-edge technology called laser ablation, blasting the teeth with powerful beams to determine which forms of strontium\u2014a metallic element found in soil and absorbed by plants\u2014they contained. Because strontium is digested by animals and incorporated into tooth enamel, it can shed light on the geological environment in which an individual reached maturity. \u201cThe strontium isotope ratios are a direct reflection of the foods these hominids ate, which in turn are a reflection of the local geology,\u201d Copeland explained in a statement.\nThe cave systems that yielded the specimens are associated with a distinct type of strontium, making it easy to pinpoint which of the individual hominins were locals. According to the analysis, more than half of the females hailed from outside the region, while 90 percent of the males grew up where they ultimately died. In other words, the females were more likely to stray from their childhood turf than their male counterparts, who tended to stick close to their home caves.\n\u201cHere we have the first direct glimpse of the geographic movements of early hominids, and it appears the females preferentially moved away from their residential groups,\u201d said Copeland.\nSimilar behavioral patterns are common in chimpanzees, bonobos and even modern humans. Among other primates, including gorillas, females remain with their original family groups while males are forced out and must roam in search of mates. In the australopithecines\u2019 case, it is unclear whether the females left home by choice\u2014possibly to seek better genetic matches than their close relatives\u2014or were abducted.\nThe findings also raised questions about the origins of upright walking, which some experts believe human ancestors first adopted in order to travel quickly and efficiently. \u201cWe assumed more of the hominids would be from non-local areas, since it is generally thought the evolution of bipedalism was due in part to allow individuals to range longer distances,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cSuch small home ranges could imply that bipedalism evolved for other reasons.\u201d\n(Two weeks ago, History in the Headlines highlighted a paper that offered another solution to the riddle of why early humans stood up. A behavioral study by David Carrier at the University of Utah suggested that ancient hominins might have adopted a bipedal stance because it allowed males the competitive advantage of striking from above while fighting rivals.)\nMatt Sponheimer, an anthropology professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder and one of the study\u2019s co-authors, pointed out that male-female dynamics were just as complex and baffling among our earliest ancestors as they are for modern humans grappling with these same issues. \u201cIt is difficult enough to work out relations between the sexes today, so the challenges in investigating the ways that male and female hominids used the landscape and formed social groups over a million years ago are considerable, to say the least,\u201d he said.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"She\u2019s Leaving Home: Our Female Ancestors\u2019 Wanderlust","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/australopithecus-thumb.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/shes-leaving-home-our-female-ancestors-wanderlust"}
