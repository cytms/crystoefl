However, fiction may have become a reality, when a single-horned deer was spotted in an Italian natural reserve.\nThe Roe deer which was born in a research park near Florence has a gene anomaly: instead of having two horns, like his twin brother, the one year-old Roe deer has a single horn, making him look that mythical creature commonly found in legends and stories.\nAccording to Italian specialists, this type of anomaly may have been discovered in the past and inspired the legend of the \u2018unicorn\u2019. There are of course, other single-horned deer, but they are very rare and usually their horn isn\u2019t centered.\nStories about unicorns are thousands of years old and seem to evolve like Chinese whispers in every new book or kid\u2019s novel. The legend began with the story of Herodotus, the father of history, who mentioned it in the 5th century BC. The creature\u2019s reputation and \u2018rarity\u2019 kindled the curiosity of some of the world\u2019s most respected scientists and inventors. One famous example, is Leonardo Da Vinci, who said that unicorns can actually be captured if a virgin is used as bait. Usually that detail is left out of his biographies.
