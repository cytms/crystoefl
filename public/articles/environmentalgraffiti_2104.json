This may be a great subject for the next Stephen King nove: living stones attacking a group of American scientists, who were trying to investigate the roots of Dracula\u2019s legend. The stones are real and known to mortals as Trovants.Photo: \nNear a village, just south of central Romania a number of stone formations with alien features lie dormant, witnesses to the passing of time; that is \u2013 until it rains. Not long after the last drops of water fall, they begin a multiplication process. Small oval or round blain-like forms appear on the upper part of them. Many people are amazed and even locals are impressed when after heavy rainfall these rock formations begin to \u2018live.\u2019 Locals have aptly dubbed them, \u201cgrowing stones.\u201d\nTrovants have a hard stone core but their shells are made of sand, as most examples have been found in sandy regions. Geologists argue that the rocks are the result of a cementation process that occurred millions of years ago in this region and it is somehow accepted that their creation has its roots in the early diagenesis. Scientifically these stones are sandstone concretions and the weird forms are achieved by an irregular secretion of cement.\nIn 2006 a museum was built to host some of these remarkable pieces. Within the walls and outside of the \u201cMuzeul Trovantilor\u201d (Trovant Museum) in Costesti, a village in the Valcea region, visitors can see various Trovants in different shapes and sizes from small examples to some that are over 10 meters tall.\nMore photos: 1 - 2\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
