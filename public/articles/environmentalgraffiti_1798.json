More photos There*Photo: image (c) Dakota Smith\nThe Department of Water and Power workers in Los Angeles, as well as local officials and community activists opened a white tub from where they poured 400,000 black colored balls into the water. So, the question is: was this an artwork, some kind of statement or attempt to pollute the water?\nPhoto: image (c) Dakota Smith\nThe answer on all fronts is no \u2013 absolutely and categorically no. In fact, it is an action intended to protect the quality of L.A. drinking water and preventing it from becoming a health hazard. The water needs to be protected and in the shade because of its composition of bromate and chlorine \u2013 if exposed to large amounts of sunlight, it could cause a chemical reaction and in high levels can cause cancer.\nLast year, abnormally high levels of bromide were signaled, but specialists claimed that danger levels were low because people had to drink the water for a lifetime - even so, the chances of contracting cancer were minimal.Photo: \nimage (c) Dakota Smith\nAfter the discovery of bromate, officials began to search for a method to shade the Ivanhoe and Elysian Reservoirs, but all suggested options would need time and a helluva  lot of money. Instead, local government followed the advice of a DWP biologist who came with the idea to use these black plastic balls you see in the pictures.\nThe reservoirs will be covered by 3 million balls for roughly 4 years.Sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Images: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
