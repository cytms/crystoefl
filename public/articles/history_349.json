Left alone, they would likely have died early in life, shortly after falling ill or as a direct result of their wounds. \u201cTo me, this suggests social care going well back into the Pleistocene,\u201d said Trinkaus.\nOther examples of early humans whom others presumably tended include a child with abnormal brain growth who lived until at least age 5 in Spain 500,000 years ago; Neanderthals who lived for years with immobilizing deformities 50,000 years ago; and a toothless individual who was apparently fed by a compassionate neighbor or relative about 180,000 years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a surprisingly high incidence of these things,\u201d Trinkaus explained.\nSo did the Maba man, whose remains were discovered in 1958 in a southern China cave, really get by with a little help from his Paleolithic friends? \u201cThe guy got a serious bump on the head,\u201d Trinkaus said, and might have been \u201cshaken up\u201d for several weeks. \u201cThe immediate effect of it would have been something akin to short-term amnesia or concussion,\u201d Trinkaus continued. \u201cThe guy would have been supported or taken care of or coddled in some way immediately afterwards.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s plenty of evidence that earlier Pleistocene individuals sustained major injuries\u2014often while hunting\u2014but lived to tell the tale, the Maba man might be the oldest known victim of assault by another person, Trinkaus added. The blow to the head that left a permanent depression in the cave dweller\u2019s skull was likely inflicted by a small, extremely hard object such as a rock or spear tip; falls and accidental collisions tend to cause more generalized cranial trauma.\nIt\u2019s nevertheless impossible to rule out a hunting accident or similar mishap, but a brawl with a rival or surprise attack by a foe would be hardly surprising, in Trinkaus\u2019 view. \u201cAll social mammals occasionally squabble,\u201d he said. \u201cAs weaponry increased through human evolution, the risk of injury increased.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Was Victim of Earliest Known Human-on-Human Attack Saved By Compassion?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/maba-cranium.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/was-victim-of-earliest-known-human-on-human-attack-saved-by-compassion"}
