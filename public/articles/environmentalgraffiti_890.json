The unmarked package--further proof that if you are smuggling dinosaur fossils, you should always mark them with something, even if it's just \"not illegal fossils\"-- represents a species that has never been found in the region of the country that recovered it, indicating a misidentification or, potentially, the laundering of these smuggled fossils.  \nThis is by no means a new phenomenon; Yale University, alma matter of George W. Bush, agreed to return a collection of over 4,000 pieces last fall that they had held for nearly 100 years. \nThe Peruvians, to their credit, are stepping up their efforts to keep their national treasures home-- the Yale case broke open under threat of a lawsuit, and seizures in 2007 doubled those of 2006.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
