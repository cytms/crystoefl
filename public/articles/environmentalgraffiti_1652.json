At first glance \u2013 not much. It\u2019s at artist Mark Langan\u2019s studio in Cleveland, OH where all the leads come together. Or should we say the cardboard pieces? Mark Langan uses corrugated material \u2013 recycled corrugated cardboard boxes \u2013 from friends\u2019 and neighbours\u2019 trash cans and turns them into amazing pieces of art. A super cool and creative way to recycle we think!\nCardboard Uncle Sam seems to have a metallic sheen:Photo: \nWould Edvard Munch \u201cScream\u201d in delight?Photo: \nMark Langan has been focusing on corrugated art since 2004 and creates his own as well as commissioned pieces. Each artwork can take about 80-100 hours to make. He markets to corrugated manufacturers, packaging companies, recycling firms and green industries who love his artworks \u2013 which adorn their boardrooms and lobbies and are used at green events. \nDoes recycled art keep board meetings focused? Photo:  \nA boring barcode has never been so beautiful:Photo: \nAsked what corrugated art is, the artist says: \u201cMy personal interpretation to the term \u201cCorrugated Art\u201d is the celebration of the unique properties of a highly visible manufactured product for which it was not purportedly intended. Striving to artistically focus by highlighting those aesthetically characteristic qualities which otherwise would be unknowingly ignored.\u201d\nOnly cardboard, non-toxic glue, razor knife, cutting edge and mat \u2013 Mark Langan at work:Photo: \nWhile Langan is particular in using only recycled materials, he shies a bit away from the label \u201cgreen.\u201d Though his motto is \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d, he is realistic enough not to claim that \u201che\u2019s making a huge dent in reducing waste material going into landfills.\u201d However, he strongly believes in inspiring others to ask, \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d when it comes to recycling. That\u2019s more than most of us can claim. We\u2019ll surely do some thinking and will not look at an old cardboard box in quite the same way again\u2026 \nFor a gallery of Langan\u2019s artworks, examples of corporate corrugated art and recycling facts, visit Mark Langan\u2019s website. \nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
