Commissioned by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the 47-volume study indicated that the U.S. government had misled the public and Congress, deceiving them about the scope, goals and progress of the increasingly unpopular war. The Times had obtained the incriminating papers from Daniel Ellsberg, a former Defense Department analyst turned antiwar activist who had smuggled them out of the Pentagon.\nThe Pentagon Papers\u2019 publication sparked a nationwide furor, galvanizing the powerful antiwar movement and damaging the credibility of America\u2019s Cold War-era foreign policy.
