It is not visible to the human eye so getting a picture right requires expertise, skill and patience. The following stunning pictures of star trails reveal the hidden paintings created by the movement of the stars, night after night.       \nWhen taking pictures of stars, the regular point-and-shoot method (i.e. a short exposure time) will result in a static picture of stars as points of light \u2013 the ones we see with the naked eye. The longer the exposure of the picture, the longer the star trail will be. This is because stars appear to move after 15 seconds, though actually it\u2019s the Earth\u2019s rotation that makes them seem to move. A good camera lens is also important as the longer the focal length, the more movement one will catch.\nAmazing star trails captured in Hokkaido, Japan:Photo: \nImage: Daita Saru\nFreelance photographer Dan Heller offers a good explanation of why star trails are special phenomena: \n\nThere are two options for taking pictures of star trails: Either taking one long-exposure photograph or taking dozens of pictures and merging them into one. Regardless of what method one chooses, a lot of patience and some photographic experience is required. The better the camera, the better the long exposure facility should be. Even though taking individual shots sounds like a lot of work, it is made a bit easier with software or plug-ins that automate the process. \nHere\u2019s a great example of multiple short-exposure shots. Only nine photographs of 30 seconds each were taken to capture these short star trails. Notice how well the car lights on the road got captured. \nRoad to Nowhere?Photo: \nImage: Aitor Escauriaza   \nStar trails appear concentric because rather than being a reflection of their own movement, they are a reflection of the Earth's daily rotation around its axis.\nPerfect circles in Big Bear, CA:Photo: \nImage: Bill S.\nStar trails photographed at the mission in San Miguel, CA:Photo: \nImage: Kevin Cole\nThe next shot was taken from the Matsell Natural Bridge Area in Linn County, IA.
