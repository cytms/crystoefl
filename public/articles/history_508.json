A number of possible causes have been put forth, including foul play, gangrene and the genetic condition known as gynecomastia, a hormone imbalance that gives males a female appearance. Recently, DNA tests and CT scans of King Tut\u2019s mummy led one group of researchers to conclude that the 19-year-old pharaoh succumbed to a fatal combination of malaria, a broken leg and a bone disorder.\nDr. Benson Harer has added a new theory to the mix: death by hippo. An Egyptology professor at California State University, Harer had previously established that Tutankhamen had severed ribs and was embalmed without his heart or anterior chest wall\u2013a departure from the strictly codified mummification process of the era. In Harer\u2019s view, this made the case for a crushing injury to the chest as the cause of death. Pointing to Egyptian pharaohs\u2019 known fondness for hippopotamus hunting, he has now suggested that a lethal hippo bite inflicted the damage.\nEven today, the hippopotamus kills dozens of people each year in Africa\u2013more than any other animal\u2014and is widely regarded as the continent\u2019s most dangerous creature (not counting the mosquito, which carries fatal diseases that affect millions). Up to 15 feet tall and weighing in at 8,000 pounds, the massive and extremely aggressive beast can easily outrun humans on its squat, stumpy legs. Its cavernous mouth and enormous teeth can disembowel or decapitate a person with a single bite. Deaths often occur when victims inadvertently get between a female hippo and her calf, unleashing the highly protective mother\u2019s fury.\nWhile hippos are no longer found in contemporary Egypt, they lived in the Nile and foraged along its banks in large numbers during ancient times. Notorious for capsizing fishing boats, destroying crops and stampeding, they were a menace to Egyptian society but inspired both fear and respect; several ancient Egyptian deities appear in the form of the hippopotamus, including the fertility goddess Taweret and Osiris\u2019 wicked brother Seth. Images of pharaohs killing hippos were common in Egyptian art and ostensibly represented the triumph of good over evil. Indeed, the storied treasure trove found in Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb includes two statuettes of the young king wielding a spear during a hippo hunt.\nThe hippopotamus\u2019 symbolic connotations may explain why the boy king\u2019s demise has remained shrouded in mystery, according to Harer. He speculates that the authorities concealed the exact cause of the pharaoh\u2019s death to avoid political instability, fearing that the public might interpret it as a negative sign from the gods. Harer\u2019s hypothesis is sure to raise a few eyebrows, but if he\u2019s right, it could mean that King Tut\u2019s run-in with a hippo has been kept under wraps since 1324 B.C.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Did a Hippo Kill King Tut?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/king-tut-thumb_large_310x206.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/did-a-hippo-kill-king-tut"}
