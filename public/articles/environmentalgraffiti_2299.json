All opinions are 100% mine.Our Review of The New Wicked Fresh Range\n\tThough we may have been commissioned to write this, we feel that when you\u2019re looking for toothpaste, mouthwash and dental floss that you can really trust, Tom's of Maine is a great company to turn to (hence why we agreed to run this). The company stretches itself to reach high ethical standards, far beyond what its rivals even consider, one example being that none of its products are tested on animals.\n\n\tRecently Tom\u2019s created a new line called Wicked Fresh, which we\u2019ve been lucky enough to try out. Their peppermint-flavored, crystal clear Wicked Fresh mouthwash leaves your whole mouth feeling clean. I tried it for the first time five days ago and I was surprised by the fact there was absolutely no burn, unlike Listerine. ?While their toothpaste might not be as sparklingly white as other brands, that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t contain the needless chemical compounds required to make that happen.\n\n\tOne of the great features of the company\u2019s website is that as well as listing every ingredient in all their products, they also list what each ingredient is for and where it is from. This gives you a better understanding of what is in the product - and complete peace of mind that the product is not doing you any harm (which is something that can be hard to gauge when you look at most packs of toothpaste).\n\n\tOverall, I would rate their new product range an 8/10 and definitely recommend their mouthwash.\n\n\tHow to Win Prizes\n\tRight now you can win Wicked Fresh!?
