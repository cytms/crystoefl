The researchers also collected 800 milk samples from the participants' households.\n\n\t\t?\n\n\t\tCompared with kids who only drank store-bought milk, those who drank raw milk had a 41-percent reduction in their odds of developing asthma. They were also only about half as likely to develop hay fever -- even after accounting for other factors that might be relevant.\n\n\t\t?\n\n\t\tOn the other hand, those who drank boiled farm milk had no less asthma than those who drank store milk.\n\n\t\t?\n\n\t\tThe protective effect was linked to so-called whey proteins in the milk, such as BSA and alpha-lactalbumin.\n\n\t\t?\n\n\t\t\"Pasteurization remains an effective tool to inactivate harmful microorganisms but may simultaneously destroy whey proteins,\" said Loss. \"The results may give rise to technological developments aiming to destroy harmful microorganisms but preserving beneficial components of milk. The ultimate aim is to use a safe and protective milk for prevention of asthma.\"\n\n\t\t?\n\n\t\tIn the U.S., more than seven percent of adults and even more kids have asthma, causing millions of visits to emergency rooms and doctors' offices every year.\n\n\t\t?\n\n\t\tSOURCE:?Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, online Aug. 29, 2011.\n\n\t\t?\n\n\t\tCopyright 2011?
