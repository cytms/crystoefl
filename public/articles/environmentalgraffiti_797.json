A single bolt of lightning killed 52 cows in San Jose, Uruguay last Wednesday, 22 October, during a night storm. According to reports, the cows were trying to find protection by huddling against a fence, but the plan backfired, quite literally, as fence-protector became fence-conductor.\nPhoto: Image: three of clubs\nIt\u2019s not the first time large numbers of cattle have had their lives cut short in a flash. In 2004 a lightning strike killed 31 cows seeking refuge under a tree in Denmark; in 2005, 68 were sizzled in the same way in New South Wales, Australia; while in September of this year another 53 of the unfortunate creatures met their maker in Katosi, Uganda, again underneath a tree. So what\u2019s with the animal attraction for these bolts from the skies?\nPhoto: Image:  Ruth Lyon-Bateman\nIt appears the run of bad luck for cows isn\u2019t just down to their tendency to loiter in fields and innocently seek shelter in thunderstorms. Another reason for the greater risk they stand is their widely spaced legs. It\u2019s known that lightning can \u2018sideflash\u2019 \u2013 jumping from one struck object to another object nearby \u2013 but it can also spread out in \u2018ground currents\u2019 when it hits the earth. And if the hind hooves are touching the ground at a spot with a different electrical potential to the front hooves, the current will travel through the cow\u2019s body and kill it. Ouch.\nSources: 1, 2, 3,  4, 5, 6, 7\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
