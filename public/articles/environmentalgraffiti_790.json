Four-year-old Lucy, a Shetland pony weighing around 100 Ibs and measuring 19.5 inches has claimed the title of Britain\u2019s smallest horse. Only this time she\u2019s a true miniature mare.\nPhoto: Image of Lucy via the Telegraph\nLucy is owned by veterinary surgeon Sandra Power, who is unclear why the pony didn\u2019t grow much bigger \u2013 she stopped growing when she reached the age of two. \nMs Power told the Telegraph newspaper: \"I wasn't expecting Lucy to be so small. She was about 15 inches when I got her at three months \u2013 that's a normal size for a Shetland foal.\u201d \nAccording to her owner, Lucy is perfectly proportioned, apart from her mane and tail, which grow at an alarming rate.\nLucy lives in custom-made stables with a door that is only 21 inches high \u2013 something that would put a kid\u2019s Wendy house to shame.\nSource 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
