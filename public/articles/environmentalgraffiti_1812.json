We\u2019re very aware of that, being environmentalists.\nHowever, some of the most beautiful and incredible occurrences are ephemeral, creative and destructive all at the same time. The above are all vital elements of the genious explosive artist Cai Guo-Qiang\u2019s work. Although not strictly environmental, more like \u201cactually\u201d destructive, Qiang\u2019s explosions and installations emulate the destructive forces of nature and technology. Unfortunately I'm not an art critic or expert, so I won't attempt to explain the works in more detail. Attempting to do that would be like tearing a butterfly to shreds in order to understand how it works.  So, without further ado, here are some of his five most amazing art pieces:\n\n5. Tornado: Explosion Project for the Festival of China\nOn October 1st 2005 in Washington D.C. USA the Potomac river was lit up for 7 minutes.\n4. Restrained Violence: Rainbow: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 25\nAt 6pm on February 28 1995 at the First Johannesburg Biennial, a building is blown up. The art piece lasts 5 seconds\n3. Inopportune\nOne of Qiang's less ephemeral pieces, Inopportune is displayed between December 12, 2004 and October 2005 at the MASS MoCA North Adams, USA.\n\n2. 45.5 Meteorite Craters Made by Humans on Their 45.5 Hundred Million Year Old Planet: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 3\nOn July 7, 1990 at 9 pm at the Chine demain pour hier exhibition, Pourrieres,  France a 10,000 meter squared controlled explosion takes place. It lasts only 3 seconds.\n1. Transient Rainbow\nOn June 29th, 2002, New York was lit up to celebrate the opening of MoMAQNS.
