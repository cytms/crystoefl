From afar a glowing red light seems to float on the horizon, enticing onlookers ever closer to peer into what seems like Dante\u2019s Inferno. Only when they arrive at the edge of the pit do they realize the bright lights are the dancing flames of a deep burning crater, known to locals as \u2018The Doorway to Hell\u2019.\nThis vast sinkhole in Turkmenistan was created many years ago by a Soviet gas company drilling for potential resources in the area. Reports of the expedition vary; some say the pit was created as early as the 1950s, another says 1971.\nWhen drilling started, the rig suddenly disappeared into the ground. It had drilled into an underground cavern, the roof of which had collapsed, forming a 60 meter-wide, 20 meters deep. It was also rich in natural gas, which was now largely unusable and escaping into the atmosphere.\nSome bright spark then thought, to contain the noxious gas, that it would be a good idea to burn it off, and so ignited the crater. Since then, the gas riddled pit has been burning indefinitely, and shows little sign of letting up.\nThere is now a lucrative tourism trade surrounding Turkmenistan\u2019s Doorway to Hell, so good in fact that a small village has erupted near the pit. Darvaza is now home to about 350 inhabitants, who live a semi-nomadic lifestyle in the region and often set up their home near the burning sinkhole. With all that gas being released into the air, let\u2019s just hope they\u2019ve got strong stomachs and a poor sense of smell.\nSource 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
