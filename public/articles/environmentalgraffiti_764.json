Most of the tuna that are bought in auctions travel directly to sushi restaurants where they are served raw to customers. The Japanese, who consume a quarter of the world's tuna, take their sushi seriously. Being a part of the first tuna catch of the year makes the new record-setting fish even more appealing. Eating a fish that has gained such media attention is a sign of prestige for the Japanese.\nPhoto: \nPhoto:  NOAA\nThe new record-setting tuna was caught in the Pacific Ocean in Northern Japan. Typically, Pacific Bluefin Tuna are more highly valued than their Atlantic Tuna counterparts.
