He claimed that by spraying cooking oil over the block it would be prevented from melting, but was uncertain how long it might last: \"That's why it looks sweaty. It actually preserves the cheese.\" One thing is for certain: if it melts before the celebrations begin, he'll be right cheesed off (apologies).\nThe replica of an iconic painting by John Trumbull shows John Adams, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin and others standing around a table signing the historic document, but this is not the first time Landwehr has recreated U.S. history with cheese. Last year he carved a cheese version of Mount Rushmore, depicting presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Abe Lincoln.\nIt is likely that the giant cheese sculpture will quickly become old news to New Yorkers as it is swamped by hordes of tourists crowding for a photo next to its sticky surface: now all together now... cheese!\nSources: 1\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
