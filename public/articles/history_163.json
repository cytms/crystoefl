The sale is not yet considered final and official, but according to reports the Colt .45 went to an anonymous online bidder. Owned by the famous bandit in the late 1890s, the revolver was described in a video released by its auctioneers as \u201cthe most fully documented Butch Cassidy gun in existence.\u201d\nCassidy, who was born in April 1866 and committed his first bank robbery in his early 20s, acquired the gun\u2014a .45-caliber Colt Single Action Army Revolver\u2014around the same time he formed an outlaw gang later known as the Wild Bunch. Relentlessly pursued by lawmen and the Union Pacific Railroad, in late 1899 or early 1900 he allegedly sought amnesty from Governor Heber Wells of Utah. But first, as an act of good faith, he surrendered his Colt, his holster and a Winchester rifle to a sheriff named Parley P. Christison.\n\u201cButch had been hunted for years, and they were getting closer and closer,\u201d Jewels Eubanks of California Auctioneers explained in the video. \u201cHe wanted a new life. He wanted to get out of it. He wanted to start something new.\u201d\nWells considered Cassidy\u2019s request but changed his mind when he discovered that the outlaw had been accused of murder. After an attempt to reconcile with Union Pacific officials also failed, Cassidy committed several more robberies before fleeing to South America with fellow bandit Harry Alonzo Longabaugh (the \u201cSundance Kid\u201d) and continuing his life of crime. His revolver, meanwhile, remained in the possession of Sheriff Christison, who apparently left it to some of his associates. By 1967 the \u201camnesty Colt,\u201d as it became known, had fallen into the hands of John Neilsen, who sold it to author and historic weapons expert E. Dixon Larson.\nIf the gun\u2019s whereabouts can be traced over the years, the same can\u2019t be said for Cassidy himself. According to the traditional narrative, he and Longabaugh met their end in a hail of bullets in Bolivia in 1908. But numerous sources over the years, including Cassidy\u2019s own sister, have disputed this account, claiming that the outlaw died decades later in the United States.\nAlong with its strong paper trail, the amnesty Colt\u2019s unique characteristics have piqued the interest of collectors and historians. Most intriguing are numbers scratched inside the gun\u2019s right grip, which some believe are the combination to an undiscovered safe in a Denver bank. \u201cI think it\u2019s an absolute treasure, one of a kind,\u201d Jewels Eubanks said. \u201cI think this is a fabulous piece of American history, and it should be placed in a fine collection,\u201d John Eubanks, also of California Auctioneers, added.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Butch Cassidy Gun With Secret Code Hidden in Grip Sells for $175,000","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/butch-cassidy-gun.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/butch-cassidy-gun-with-secret-code-hidden-in-grip-sells-for-175000"}
