This conserves females and helps maximize how many bears can be killed for fur, hunting purposes, and during traditional Inuit bear hunts.\nThis has caused some people to worry that the male population will become reduced to the point where female polar bears cannot find a mate.  The polar bear is listed as a vulnerable species, meaning it is at risk for extinction. Local studies are suggesting that 7 of the 19 subpopulations of polar bears are declining.  The new study is based on the Allee effect, where individuals of many species have reduced fitness when their population densities are low.  One common example of this is the saiga antelope. The team fears the polar bear may suffer the same fate.\nSource: Telegraph\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"No Love for Female Polar Bears","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/800px-Polarbearsnearnorthpolejpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/no-love-for-female-polar-bears/540"}
