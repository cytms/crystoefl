Get a graffiti artist week? In the space of seven days, one of the world\u2019s most famous street artists has been in various brushes with the law. Late last week, Shepard Fairey, creator of the \u2018Hope\u2019 portrait of Barack Obama that showed up everywhere in the election campaign, was arrested in Boston. The charges of vandalism relate to Fairey\u2019s earlier, equally iconic work, the ubiquitous \u2018Obey\u2019 street art campaign. The arrest came just days after Fairey was in the headlines for allegedly illegally using a photo of Obama owned by the Associated Press.\nNot keeping the peace: 'Obey'-based Fairey piece in BostonPhoto: Image: redgoldfly\nFairey was arrested on the graffiti charges while on his way to Boston\u2019s Institute of Contemporary Art for the opening night of his first major museum exhibition in the US last Friday. He is suspected of damaging property with graffiti derived from the \u2018Obey\u2019 street art imagery, and one of the warrants dates back to 2000.\nFrom street art campaigns\u2026 Photo: Image: yoyolabellut\nStickers and stencils of the \u2018Obey\u2019 design, which show an image of famed professional wrestler Andre the Giant, began to appear in major cities in the US and beyond in the 80s and 90s. With no clear political message, \u2018Obey\u2019 was nevertheless, as Robert L. Pincus pointed out, \u201csuggestively antiauthoritarian\u201d. The propaganda-like sloganeering and wink towards corporate commercialism resonated with a generation of young people.\n\u2026To election campaignsPhoto: Image: David Shankbone\n\u2018Obey\u2019 seems a far cry from the more mainstream and explicitly political \u2018Hope\u2019, which some say was a powerful enough symbol to be instrumental in Obama\u2019s election success. The stylised portrait, which appeared on thousands of posters and t-shirts and now hangs in the US National Portrait Gallery, drew a personal note of thanks to Fairey from the now President.\nSpot the difference: the AP original and the new \u2018Hope\u2019Photo: Image: gunthert \nBut this was no help to Fairey as earlier last week the Associated Press demanded compensation for alleged copyright infringement. The AP claims that because the original photo of Obama was theirs, Fairey needed permission to use it. Fairey\u2019s lawyers have countersued, saying that the use of the image falls under \u2018fair use\u2019, whereby the public can copy work without permission for purposes such as parody or education.\nInstitutionalised? Fairey in the Institute of Contemporary Art Photo: Image: Flintstonepearl\nWhatever the outcome of this legal wrangling, it doesn\u2019t seem to have been Fairey\u2019s week \u2013 and people could be forgiven for seeing this as more than mere coincidence. The arrest in particular has led to speculation that there are those in Boston\u2019s establishment who aren\u2019t best pleased that a known purveyor of graffiti should be getting the cultural acclaim of his own exhibition in their city. But Fairey \u2013 who has had countless run-ins with the police, and also has a track record as a guerrilla marketer \u2013 must by now be used to getting it in the neck for his activities.\nNo Protection? Orr\u2019s take on the giant imagePhoto: Image: Baxter Orr\nFairey is not without his less conventional opponents either. Other artists have criticised him for being something of a magpie who simply appropriates the work of others without adding enough to make his pieces original. Ironic, then, that last year Fairey threatened his own legal action against designer Baxter Orr for using \u2018Obey\u2019 in a parody called \u2018Protect\u2019, in which the graphic of the giant is covered with a respiratory mask.\nWho\u2019s original?Photo: \nImage: BAHNHOF-SHOP\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong while people appear to rip images off like so many layers of wheatpasted posters. One thing seems sure, though: when street art goes mainstream, the knives come out from one place or another.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
