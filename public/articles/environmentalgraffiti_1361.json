Urban landscapes supply the settings and traceurs supply the sick moves as concrete spaces are navigated with grace and style. Although we'd never hit on it directly before, parkour and free-running are also environmentally friendly activities in a big way \u2013 now more than ever and for more reasons than one.\nRaising a flag...Photo: \nOn September 26, 2009, the largest ever global free-running jam took place, as over 3,000 traceurs in 35 countries teamed up in a bid to flip the status quo by calling for a world with clean power. In terms of size, the jam set a Guinness world record, and it was also the first happening of its kind held in support of tackling climate change. \n...in Mar del Plata, ArgentinaPhoto: \nFrom Sydney to Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong to London, over 100 cities were involved as events sprung to life in sync around the globe. Organised by environmental action group Sandbag together with pro traceurs from Parkour Generations, the free-running jam worked to spearhead the One Giant Leap climate change campaign.  \nNot only in Rio....Photo: \nThe motivational springboard for the events was simple. The way we generate power makes up to a quarter of global carbon emissions, with just over 3000 power stations worldwide responsible. One Giant Leap is about us cleaning up our act. It's not that we can't, argue the campaigners: the technology is there; all that's needed is the political will.\n...but also in SydneyPhoto: \nSandbag Founder and Director Bryony Worthington said: \u201cWe\u2019re asking world leaders to focus their efforts on agreeing laws that will deliver a real change on the ground \u2013 creating massive investment in clean, safe forms of electricity. We\u2019ll need clean electricity to heat our homes and power our cars in a low-carbon future. A deal for clean power can start to tackle climate change in One Giant Leap.\u201d\nPositive group think: Hong KongPhoto: \nWorthington also explained how l\u2019art du d?placement fits into all of this: \"The parkour network is a great example of a global community that has come together to take action. Their involvement has been particularly impressive in places with the highest power sector emissions such as Australia, China, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United States and Europe.\" \nTraceurs as one: Ghangzou, ChinaPhoto: \nThe events in China were particularly interesting in the context of the worldwide free-running jam because civil society rarely gets the chance to take part in events and activities there. The people at Sandbag said they felt proud they were able to give people an opportunity to take action.\nFlipping things on their head: EgyptPhoto: \nAnd parkour and free-running have not only made a leap in terms of putting positive pressure on the world's governments; they're also setting an example as emission-free activities in themselves. Think about it: practically all you need to take part is suitable shoes, a little imagination, and the desire to do it \u2013 however much practice it might take.\nOverturning old ideas: Puebla, MexicoPhoto: \nDan Edwardes, Director of Parkour Generations, spelled it out: \u201cParkour is a low-carbon and environmentally sustainable activity, and parkour groups have a long history of positive engagement with the local community and environment, neither of which can thrive without a safe climate.\u201d  \nGoing over your head? MP David Millaband got the traceur treatment in LondonPhoto: \nThe One Giant Leap petition is calling on world leaders to cut a tough climate deal, drop global power emissions by 10% and roll out clean electricity everywhere. A deal like this would enable the world to peak carbon emissions by 2020, say Sandbag. With the UN climate change talks coming up in December, you can help by signing the petition here.\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
