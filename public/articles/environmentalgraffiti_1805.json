The beauty of it is that there is no shortage of shredded paper in any office in the world. What's more, it's at least as strong as wood, far more interesting and not to mention environmentally friendly.\nThe furniture is available as part of Praet's One Day Paper Waste initiative. He took all of the paper he used in a day, and tried to figure out how he could best re-use it. The solution was a mini-desk that you see him holding below, and the rest, as they say, is history. Of course, on another level, every shredded document tells a story; one that is perhaps lost and  fragmented, one that is part of history.\nStretching the imagination a bit, picture your credenza - wouldn't it be amazing if it contained ballots from Florida in 2000, or proof of who really shot JFK. The concept is really cool. All of us here at Environmental Graffiti love it.\nImage from Jenspraet.com\nSources: 1 , 2\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
