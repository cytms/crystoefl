Many of Titanic\u2019s crewmembers hailed from Southampton, and more than a third of the ship\u2019s victims\u2014549 people\u2014called the city home. Today the city features dozens of memorials to the dead, including one dedicated to the eight doomed musicians who served as members of Titanic\u2019s band, and a newly opened maritime history museum that explores the impact of Titanic on the people of Southampton. Visitors can even sneak a peek at Dock Gate 4, now known as Ocean Dock, where Titanic spent some if its final days.  \nPier 54 continued operations for much of the 20th century, serving as a dock for luxury liners, World War II transport ships and freight lines. Cunard\u2019s lavish passenger depot, designed by the same firm that built New York\u2019s Grand Central Station, later fell into disrepair and was demolished in the 1990s. However, the original pier and entry archway used by Titanic\u2019s survivors in April 1912 are still standing and are now part of Hudson River Park, a popular recreational area. \nMore than 30 undertakers from around Nova Scotia traveled to Halifax to assist the families, and for the next several weeks a local sporting rink served as a temporary morgue set up to assist in identification. Eventually, 150 of the recovered bodies were buried in three of Halifax\u2019s cemeteries, including Fairview Lawn Cemetery, where a special section paid for by the White Star Line is home to 121 victims. There are dozens of Titanic-related sites in Halifax, including churches that held services for the ship\u2019s victims, memorials and the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, which houses a permanent exhibition illustrating Halifax\u2019s role as the final resting place of many of Titanic\u2019s dead.","author":"Barbara  Maranzani","web_category":"news","title":"Titanic Today: A Transatlantic Tour","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/belfast.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/titanic-today-a-transatlantic-tour"}
