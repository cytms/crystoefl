It\u2019s a real live poodle. Meet Cindy, also known as Leonardoodle, and her owner, Sandy Paws. The picture before you is just one of Ms Paws\u2019 executions of \u201ccreative grooming\u201d. We\u2019re really not sure if it\u2019s ethical, but here are some more jaw-dropping examples of Sandy\u2019s canine-sprucing makeovers on Cindy.\nPicture perfectPhoto: Image: pinkcoyote\nPeople might claim that someone who does this sort of thing to dogs has got some answering to do. One dog-lover even wondered how she would like it if she were forced to have an all over body tattoo made up of stuff in dogs\u2019 imaginations \u2013 bones, say, or rubber balls. A hair-brained remark if ever there was one \u2013 you see, Cindy has lots of guises, none of them permanent \u2013 though you can see what the guy was getting at.\nCamel dogPhoto: Image: pinkcoyote\nIn any case, clearly the judges don\u2019t see things the same way as the critics. Yes, folks, this is creative grooming at it\u2019s finest; award winning creative grooming. It seems Sandy and Cindy have been scooping prizes everywhere from Burbank in the duo\u2019s native California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, and you can\u2019t fault the skill of Sandy\u2019s handiwork \u2013 or its, erm, imagination. Who would ever think of transforming a dog into a camel \u2013 or a dragon?\nDragon dogPhoto: Image: pinkcoyote\nNow don\u2019t get us wrong, there are heaps of good reasons for conventional dog grooming, including the fact that it cleans the dog, improves the health of its skin and coat, and lessens the chance of skin problems. \u201cBut not when you\u2019re using dyes in every colour of the rainbow!\u201d cried one observer in horror. \u201cAnd just look at that thing, reduced to the status of a chicken, or a punk rocker \u2013 I don\u2019t know which is worse!\u201d\nChicken punk dogPhoto: Image: pinkcoyote\nIn Sandy Paws\u2019 defence, she claims to use only semi-permanent hair colour, blo-pens, coloured artists\u2019 chalk with a smidgen of hairspray, temporary spray colour \u2013 what else? \u2013 oh yes, and all the \u201cspecial touches\u201d \u2013 add-ons such as feathers, pompoms and plastic flowers. A veritable arsenal of colourants, props and adhesives, then, though apparently nothing Sandy wouldn\u2019t use on herself. That\u2019s OK then. \nA space dog-esseyPhoto: Image: brojsimpson\nOne other point made by those who see grooming in general as an important part of dog care is that it helps to build a relationship between the dog and owner. Well, judging from the photos, Sandy is certainly enjoying the bonding sessions. But is it us, or does Cindy look as though she\u2019s not quite so pleased to be there?\nPeacock dogPhoto: Image: brojsimpson\nFor those who are left a little queasy by the whole concept \u2013 if not by the garish colours then by its syrupy beauty queen sheen \u2013 the good news is that there\u2019s a whole sub-culture out there. 25 years young and with a readership of 20,000, magazine Groomer to Groomer is a mouthpiece for all things groom-tastic. Scary? Needless to say, Sandy and Cindy have made the front cover.\nMaking the front pagesPhoto: Image: pinkcoyote\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
