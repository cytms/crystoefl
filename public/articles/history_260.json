He would spend the next 24 years exploring distant lands and documenting his observations, which would later be published in a manuscript known as \u201cThe Travels of Marco Polo.\u201d By the explorer\u2019s own account, he ventured deep into China and Mongolia, serving for some time in the court of Mongol emperor Kublai Khan. Polo eventually returned to Venice, where he died a wealthy merchant.\nAs early as the mid-18th century, some people began raising doubts about Marco Polo\u2019s travels, pointing to seemingly glaring omissions in his descriptions of the Far East. In 1995 historian Frances Wood argued in her book \u201cDid Marco Polo Go to China?\u201d that the famous Venetian never made it past the Black Sea. She noted that his travelogue leaves out the Great Wall of China, the practice of binding women\u2019s feet, chopsticks and tea drinking, among other details; furthermore, Chinese documents from Polo\u2019s day make no mention of the explorer and his retinue.\nWood and other scholars have argued that Marco Polo based his tales of China and Mongolia on information gleaned from fellow traders who had actually been there. Last year a team of Italian researchers became the latest skeptics to dismiss Polo\u2019s claims, saying that archaeological evidence doesn\u2019t support his account of Kublai Khan\u2019s Japanese invasions. For instance, Polo described the Mongol fleet\u2019s ships as having five masts, but excavations have only turned up three-masted vessels.\nNow, however, research by Hans Ulrich Vogel of Germany\u2019s Tubingen University might help restore Marco Polo\u2019s integrity. In a new book entitled \u201cMarco Polo Was in China,\u201d the professor of Chinese history counters the arguments most frequently made by skeptics in an attempt to prove once and for all that the Venetian spoke the truth. He suggests, for example, that Polo didn\u2019t include the Great Wall in his chronicles because the impressive monument only achieved its great proportions under the Ming dynasty, several hundred years later. Vogel further maintains that Chinese records from the 13th and 14th centuries routinely glossed over visits from Western envoys, making Polo\u2019s exclusion less peculiar.\nHistorians before him have touched on these issues while defending Marco Polo\u2019s honor, but Vogel also relies on another compelling body of evidence: the explorer\u2019s meticulous descriptions of currency and salt production in the Yuan era. According to Vogel, Polo documents these aspects of Mongol Chinese civilization in greater detail than any of his Western, Arab or Persian contemporaries, a hint that the Venetian relied on his own powers of observation. Polo\u2019s claims about the size of paper money and the value of salt, among other aspects, check out against archaeological evidence and Chinese documents maintained by Yuan officials, Vogel concluded.\nWill we ever know whether Marco Polo traveled to China and attended Kublai Khan? Perhaps not, but the consequences of his real or fictional journey are still felt across the globe. One avid reader of \u201cThe Travels of Marco Polo\u201d was Christopher Columbus, who stumbled upon the New World while following in his Venetian idol\u2019s (figurative) footsteps.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Marco Polo Went to China After All, Study Suggests","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/marco-polo.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/marco-polo-went-to-china-after-all-study-suggests"}
