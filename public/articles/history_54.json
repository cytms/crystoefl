Signed \u201cHerbert de Grassen,\u201d supposedly a \u201csenior warden\u201d at the popular tourist attraction and prison, the leaflet offered admission to \u201cview the annual ceremony of washing the lions\u201d on April 1. Such an event could have indeed taken place two decades earlier, but the Tower\u2019s famous menagerie\u2014which for 600 years featured bears, leopards, lions and other dangerous beasts\u2014had closed in 1835. Nevertheless, a certain number of would-be spectators showed up for the display, only to learn they\u2019d fallen prey to an April Fools\u2019 hoax.\n1957: Spaghetti grows on trees\nLeave it to the Brits to concoct one of history\u2019s most memorable April Fools\u2019 Day pranks. On April 1, 1957, the BBC aired a segment in which a Swiss farming family harvested long strands of pasta from their spaghetti trees. In England at that time, Spaghetti was still an exotic delicacy with mysterious origins, so many viewers bought the report hook, line and sinker. Some even called in to ask how to grow spaghetti trees of their own. The BBC reportedly suggested, \u201cPlace a sprig of spaghetti in a tin of tomato sauce and hope for the best.\u201d\n1962: Swedish televisions don pantyhose\nOn April 1, 1962, a supposed technical expert for Sweden\u2019s one and only television channel made an exciting announcement. By stretching out a pair of nylon stockings and taping it over their screens, he reported, viewers could watch the usual black-and-white broadcast in stunning color. Television owners rushed to implement the astonishingly simple hack, only to be disappointed when the hose did nothing but obscure the picture. Regular color programming would eventually debut in Sweden on April 1, 1970.\n1972: The Loch Ness Monster surfaces\nVery few April Fools\u2019 Days go by without some Nessie-related hoax, but in 1972 a widely published photograph convinced many that Loch Ness\u2019 elusive dweller had finally made an appearance\u2014sadly, dead rather than alive. It turned out that a prankster from Yorkshire\u2019s Flamingo Park Zoo had dumped the body of a bull elephant seal in the lake. He had only intended to play a joke on his coworkers, but the \u201cnews\u201d quickly went viral.\n1976: Gravity takes a hiatus\nOn April 1, 1976, the BBC pulled off yet another of its many April Fools\u2019 Day pranks. Astronomer Sir Patrick Moore told listeners that at 9:47 a.m. that day, the temporary alignment of Pluto and Jupiter would cause a reduction in Earth\u2019s gravity, allowing people to briefly levitate. Sure enough, at 9:48, hundreds of enthralled callers flooded the lines with reports that they had floated in the air.\n1992: Richard Nixon makes a comeback\nTricky Dick running for president\u2014again? That\u2019s what National Public Radio\u2019s \u201cTalk of the Nation\u201d program revealed on April 1, 1992. The segment even included a clip in which the disgraced politician intoned, \u201cI never did anything wrong, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d As outraged listeners called in to express their dismay, the station admitted the announcement was a hoax. Comedian Rich Little, known for his spot-on impression of the 37th president, had played the role of Nixon.\n1998: Lefties get their own burger\nIn a full-page advertisement in USA Today, Burger King unveiled a new menu item specifically engineered for southpaws: the Left-Handed Whopper. According to the fast food chain, the burger\u2019s condiments were rotated 180 degrees to better suit the 1.4 million lefties who patronized its restaurants. Thousands of customers requested the new burger, swallowing an April Fools\u2019 Day whopper as they ordered their Whopper.\n2000: People Google with their minds\nNow famous for its annual hoaxes, Google played its first April Fools\u2019 Day prank in 2000. Visitors to the search engine\u2019s website learned about a new \u201cMentalPlex\u201d technology that supposedly read people\u2019s minds, thereby bypassing the need to type in a query. Google has orchestrated an increasing number of elaborate ruses in the years since, announcing such products and features as Google Nose, Gmail Motion and PigeonRank.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"8 Zany April Fools\u2019 Day Hoaxes","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/april-fools-hoaxes.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/8-zany-april-fools-day-hoaxes"}
