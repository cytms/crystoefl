The march takes place in over two hundred cities around the world. However, the biggest and best part is in Toronto, where lenient cannabis laws married with political pressure from liberals has mushroomed the size of the event.\nLiterally thousands of potheads of all ages took to the streets. The protest was noisy: people shouted slogans such as \u201cfree the weed,\u201d motorists honked their horns in approval and huge wafts of Marijuana smoke perfumed the air.\nPolice presence was barely evident \u2013 there were only a few officers surrounding the park and controlling the flow of people.\nIt\u2019s not really surprising that this was the case. Everyone seems to be pretty confused on the whole issue. In Canada. marijuana is not only used for medical purposes, but the liberal government tried to decriminalize it in 2006. Unfortunately the conservatives stepped in (as usual) and quashed the bill.\nOne can only hope that once the smoke settles, a definitive stance is reached either way because it isn\u2019t healthy to leave issues hanging in the air.\nWe\u2019d love to hear your opinion on the issue and if any of you attended the march it would be great to hear some of your stories!\nSources: CTV.ca,  reuters\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
