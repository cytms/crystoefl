A nation known, at least among famously bookish Americans, largely for having a phenomenal Bikini Team, now has a professor who is taking care to warn the women of the world:  don't wear bras that are too tight.Photo: Image from citycvhswm on Flickr\n\nProfessor Goran Samsioe of Lund University has announced that wearing a bra that is too tight may adversely affect how the female form, er, forms.  Apparently elastic tissue in the body, which serves a support purpose not unlike that of the brassiere itself, is stunted if not presented with the challenge of natural movement on a daily basis.  If the movement is restricted too much, this tissue won't fully develop, leading to a--cover your eyes, faint of heart-- decrease in the distance between the nipples and the ground among women who wear bras.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
