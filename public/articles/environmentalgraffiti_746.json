And would you rather take gross or venomous? Here\u2019s our Top Ten countdown of nature\u2019s most diabolical insects. But be advised, if you\u2019re the jumpy kind, proceed at your own risk\u2026\nInsects are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, with species of common insects like bees, wasps, true bugs, moths and beetles ranging in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Given this diversity, picking only ten of the most \u201cdiabolical\u201d was not an easy feat. And considering the fact that these insects make up just one million classified insects (more than half of all known organisms) of six to ten million still waiting to be discovered, undoubtedly there are more diabolical ones still lurking somewhere. But for now, read on for the known ones.\n10. Cockroaches\nIncluding cockroaches of any species in a Top Ten list of most diabolical insects for me was a no-brainer. I\u2019ve lived for many years in humid, well-populated climates perfect for cockroaches and had my fair share of cockroach experiences of the third kind. So yes, I\u2019m biased but hey, at least I didn\u2019t put them in the top slot!\nHissing cockroach close-up:Photo: \nImage: Jason Scragz\nFor those who think they\u2019re not that bad, just let the names of the following cockroach species roll off your tongue: true death\u2019s head cockroach (Blaberus craniifer), false death\u2019s head (Blaberus discoidalis), blabbering devil\u2019s apprentice (Blaberus luciferus).\nOkay, I made up the last one but you never know, among 4,000 cockroach species, one might just be named like that. Did you know that of those 4,000 species, only 30 are associated with human habitation? The four most well-known pests of those 30, if their point of origin is anything to go by, definitely seem to have caught the travel bug: there\u2019s the American cockroach, the German one and the Asian and Oriental cockroaches.\nGiant hissing cockroach on the hand (would you dare?):Photo: \nImage: Jason Scragz\nDid you also know that cockroaches are protein-rich and apparently easier to raise than crickets? Which is why they are often bred as fodder for other animals such as reptiles. Listen to this Wikipedia paragraph about the South American Dubya, er, Dubia cockroach:\n\n\nThey've got a point there, especially about the odour.\nAnd if you\u2019re familiar with the saying that if you see one cockroach, it means there are 1,000 in hiding, here\u2019s why: Cockroaches leave chemical trails in their feces as guides to sources of food and water. As social critters, they also do like to know where fellow cockies are hiding.\n9. Potato Bugs\nBefore we get any further into the life of the Jerusalem cricket, a.k.a. the potato bug, let\u2019s deconstruct two common myths: It is neither native of Jerusalem nor does it feed on potatoes. Instead, it can be found along the Pacific Coast of the western United States and Mexico, nibbling on dead organic material, other insects, or decaying root plants or tubers with its strong mandibles.\nLet me out! Jerusalem cricket in a box:Photo: \nImage: Jason Rojas\nJust because they are not the cutest of all insects, potato bugs are assumed to be venomous, cry like babies and rub their legs together to make a sound \u2013 more untrue common myths. They can, however, emit a foul smell and cause a painful bite and are extremely unpopular.\nIn fact, so strong is the aversion towards potato bugs for some, that groups of like-minded people have formed. Listen to the description of the potatobugs.com website: \u201cThis site is dedicated to the fabrication and perpetuation of fear, hate and disgust for the Potato Bug, the most universally feared, hated and disgusting creatures on the planet.\u201d\nPotato bug close-up:Photo: \nImage via Potatobugs\nMakes you feel almost sad for the little critter.\n8. Earwigs\nEarwigs, though found annoying by many because of their ability to pop out of nowhere \u2013 magazines, newspapers, wicker furniture, computer keyboards and other damp places \u2013 are perfectly harmless. What is interesting though is how they got their name. According to folklore, probably of the ancient oral tradition considering earwig fossils have been found in the Jurassic period, the earwig was supposed to burrow into the brains of humans via the ear and then lay eggs. Yuk! But up to the present day, something that won\u2019t go out of your head, like a tune or jingle, is called earwig (\u201cOhrwurm\u201d) in German.\nOne-inch long, newly molten earwig found in the photographer\u2019s backyard in Vallejo, California:Photo: \nImage: Joel Ignacia\nA St. Helena Giant Earwig, now believed to be extinct. No way would that thing fit into the ear canal! Photo: \nImage: Takeshi Yamada\n7. Giant Wetas\nThe Giant Weta may look scary and for an insect, reach the humongous size of 10 cm (4 in) and weigh up to 70 g \u2013 the largest Giant Weta ever found was a pregnant one weighing almost 71 g \u2013 but they are truly gentle giants. They prefer a vegetarian diet and don\u2019t kick or bite; to ward off predators they just raise their spiky hind legs. Because of their weight, Giant Wetas cannot jump and therefore try to frighten with their looks. Their genus name is Deinacrida, Greek for terrible grasshopper, and the Maori prefer Wetapunga to the long name, Little Barrier Island Giant Weta, meaning \u201cGod of ugly things.\u201d\nGiant Weta close-up:Photo: Brian Eting \nThough the Weta is also native to South Africa, South America and Australia, New Zealanders regard them a bit as their national treasure because the largest species can be found there.\nA female Cook Strait Giant Weta on Maud Island in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand:Photo: \nImage: Mike Locke \nSays photographer Mike Locke about his amazing capture (on film that is):\n\n\n6. Titan Beetles\nThe Titan beetle (Titanus giganteus) is the largest known beetle in the Amazon rainforest; one specimen, with antennae extended, measured 23 cm (9 in)! It is an extremely rare species of the South American Longhorn beetle family and famous for its strong mandibles that can snap small pieces of wood and even cut into flesh.\nChild\u2019s play?

Foam Grasshoppers\nThe foam grasshopper (Dictyophorus spumans) can be found in southern Africa and their trademark is protecting themselves by secreting a stinking foam when threatened. Ken Preston-Mafham writes in the \u201cEncyclopedia of Land Invertebrate Behaviour\u201d (MIT Press, 1993) about a personal observation of the charming little critter: \u201c[It] produces... such a nauseating stench that it surrounds the grasshopper in a protective chemical umbrella extending up to 1 m all around it.\u201d Lovely.\nA black foam grasshopper with its distinct red markings:Photo: \nImage: Kyknoord\nA close cousin of the black foam grasshopper from the same area of the world is not any better behaved. The milkweed grasshopper (Phymateus morbillosus) feeds on poisonous milkweed and spews out a toxic liquid from openings near its hind legs when threatened.\nGreen and toxic \u2013 the milkweed grasshopper:Photo: \nImage via What's that bug \n4. Blister Beetles\nThe blister beetle is a tricky fellow because on the one hand, as its name suggests, it secretes the poisonous chemical cantharidin that causes blistering of the skin and painful swelling for humans. On the other hand, however, this chemical has many medicinal uses, the most common (and effective) of which is to remove warts. The chemical compound has also been used as an aphrodisiac in the past.\nBeetle juice, anyone?

Mutillidaes\nThe Mutillidae is the real charmer of the insect world. First of all, this wasp pretends to be an ant, a velvet ant to be precise owing to the red fluff on its body. It invades other wasps\u2019 and bees\u2019 nests but cannot be harmed by their stings because of its own tough body structure. Its own sting is very painful and said to be so powerful that it can kill a cow, hence the common name cow killer. This is not true though. Mutillidaes can be found all over the world, mainly in desert and sandy areas, and more than 5,000 species exist.\nHairy ant impostor: Photo: \nImage: Scott\nDo blonde jokes also apply to ants, er, wasps?Photo: \nImage: Kathleen Franklin\n2. Mosquitos\nWithout doubt, no list of 10 most diabolical insects would be complete without the mosquito. Though it doesn\u2019t look very intimidating or diabolical, this tiny insect is claimed to have single-handedly killed more than half the humans that have ever lived through its role in the transmission of malaria and yellow fever. In Africa alone, it kills one child under the age of five every 30 seconds and worldwide one to three million people every year.\nAn Anopheles stephensi mosquito in full flight and with its abdomen full of blood:Photo: \nImage: Hugh Sturrock\nThe Asian Tiger mosquito may have a pretty, striped body but when it sits on someone\u2019s hand it still triggers the slap reflex: Photo: \nImage: Janice Bovancovich\n1. Centipedes\nCentipedes are not only found revolting by many because of their pale colouring and ability to crop up out of nowhere; with their trademark one pair of legs per body segment, they are the term \u201ccreepy crawly\u201d personified.\nAnother irritating trait is that they can literally crop up anywhere as they are adaptable to climates  anywhere on earth, from tropical rainforests to deserts. And did we mention yet that they do possess a pair of venom claws?\nHere\u2019s looking at you, kid:Photo: \nImage: Stefano Moscardini\nIf you have an overactive imagination like myself and you dare look closer at the next picture, you will see that ants are crawling on the poor Japanese centipede of the Scolopendra family, indicating that he\u2019s dead. Now, if you look at the bottom of the picture, upwards from the one severed red leg, you will notice a faint white line, maybe a piece of thread. Looks like the crime scene of \u201cWho Murdered Creepy Scolop\u201d\u2026\nLet the forensic guys move in and then send him for post mortem\u2026Photo: \nImage: Takato Marui\nThe Scolopendra gigantea is the largest terrestrial invertebrate, reaching lengths from 26 cm (10 in) to over 30 cm (12 in). On top of that, it is carnivorous and feeds on lizards, frogs, birds, mice, bats and at times even tarantulas. Its potent venom is toxic even to humans and bites are painful, causing swelling, chills, fever and weakness, but are not fatal.\nWatch the following 5-minute video ONLY IF you think you can stomach seeing a giant Scolopendra gigantea robusta kill and eat a mouse. I lasted about half a minute, then I got the idea.\nPhew, I have to admit this article was difficult to write. This isn't because I suffer from entomophobia (fear of insects) \u2013 frequent readers will know it\u2019s rather the opposite \u2013 but because I couldn\u2019t shake the urge to scratch myself while writing. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to see what\u2019s been crawling on my back all along\u2026\nSource: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
