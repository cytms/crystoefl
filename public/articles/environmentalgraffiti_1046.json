Professor John Bourne, who led the study, attributed the discrepancy between the evidence and King\u2019s recommendation to the government\u2019s need to be seen to be doing something.  Meanwhile the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ducked the issue, commenting that it was \u201cextremely difficult\u201d and that they were \u201ccommitted to evidence-based policy decisions.\u201d (Well, that\u2019s a relief). \nAround 2,500 cows are infected with tuberculosis every year in the UK, but more than ten times that amount are slaughtered annually in an attempt to prevent the disease from spreading.  The British farming industry is struggling after the effects of a series of epidemics including foot-and-mouth and mad-cow disease, and the government is keen to win farmers back to their side through tough legislation.\nThe Badger Trust called the report a \u201cshameful political fix\u201d, pointing out that \u201cKing's list of recommendations repeat virtually word for word the opinions of farming unions and the cull mad vets in Defra.\u201d A government consultation of more than 47,000 people found that more than 95% of people opposed the idea of a cull.  \nSources: The Badger Trust; BBC\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Maryking","web_category":"nature","title":"UK Government-Sponsored Massacre!","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb31.webshots.com-41374-2333990670104237032S500x500Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/uk-government-sponsored-massacre/371"}
