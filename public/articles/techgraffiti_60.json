Until that happens, very few people have the impetus to change their lifestyles significantly and politicians therefore, will have very little incentive to sponsor progressive legislation.\nMaybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re not shocked but happy to see that somehow Americans are tightening the belt a notch in the face of four dollar gasoline: for the first time in 30 years, we\u2019re driving less.\nFor years fuel costs have been spiraling upwards: regular unleaded was $1.20 when we started driving, back when the dollar was strong and the worst thing a President could ever do was lie in a civil deposition about an affair. The economists have speculated on TV when Americans would finally feel so much pain from them that our habits would change. The answer, apparently, is when the national average price is $3.65 a gallon.\nThat marks the highest price ever, even adjusting for inflation to include the 1970s in the mix. Paired with a weak economy, 71% of Americans say it\u2019s causing a financial hardship and 80% believe the gas prices are here to stay. This is ?of course, hardly something worth celebrating. It\u2019s the result of a failed energy and economic policy, both coming home to roost simultaneously. What matters is that we are, as a nation, learning to cut back. We\u2019ve pointed it out once before, but we\u2019ll do it again: Americans hadn\u2019t cut back prior to this in 30 years. And it seems highly likely that once better fuel-efficiency is demanded, and a sensible energy policy formed as a result of this crisis, we\u2019ll take ages to go back to the way we were before\u2013if society as a whole isn\u2019t transformed by then.\nYou never know.\n[ThinkProgress][USAToday][HuffingtonPost]\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
