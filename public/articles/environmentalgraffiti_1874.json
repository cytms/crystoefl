It has teeth that look as if they have been replaced, but backwards, as well as two long canines like a saber-toothed tiger's. Add the fact that it was a vegetarian, so really shouldn't have needed those saber teeth, and bizarre is a word that fits this dinosaur's description very well.\nPhoto: Eurekalert\nThe fossil is 260 million years old and belongs to a group of animals that were precursors to mammals. The discovery, made by Juan Carlos Cisneros and others at the Universidade Federal do Piau?, Ininga, also found \"some of the earliest evidence of therapsid dental occlusion \u2013 where top and bottom teeth fit together for an efficient chew,\" according to the journal, Science. \nPhoto: Eurekalert\nIt's believed the dinosaur with the toothy grin actually used the saber teeth to scare predators off, rather like musk deer do today, and during breeding season it is likely they confronted other males with the long teeth as well. Another piece of our evolutionary puzzle to be wondered over!","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"science","title":"The Vegetarian Saber-Toothed Dinosaur!","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb28.webshots.com-14555-2760646110104391629S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/paleontology/news-vegetarian-saber-tooth-dinosaurtruly-eccentric"}
