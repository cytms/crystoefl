Tattoos that range from Disney characters such as Ariel the Mermaid to Louis Vuitton logos are spread all over the pig's body. It\u2019s a gradual process, that results in the pigs looking like Yakuza gang members. They are then killed at a certain age and their skins are stretched across canvases and made into paintings.\nImage by Flickr user Dalbera\nImage by Flickr user Dalbera\nTypical of Delvoye\u2019s beautiful/fugly aesthetics, he considers the pigs as growing paintings and regularly perverts nature in his work. With the help of a Japanese scientist for example, Delvoye made a machine that\u2019s sole purpose was to produce shit: this 2000 piece  was entitled \u2018Cloaca.\u2019\nIn 2005 Delvoye extended the pigs\u2019 pieces by opening a pig farm in China where the rules are less strict towards animal welfare. Named \u2018The Art Farm Pigs Growth Fund,\u2019 the farm is home to nine sows and nine boars and of course three resident tattoo artists.\nDelvoye who saves the pigs from Chinese slaughter houses claims that \u2018art has saved their lives\u2019, the pigs however are eventually stuffed or skinned to become \u2018paintings\u2019 and \u2018sculptures.\u2019 The complexities that arise from this bizarre situation can be legitimized by seeing it as art or it can be seen as inane and cruel, watch the video and decide for yourself.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
