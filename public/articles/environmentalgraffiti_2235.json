The report \u201cThe case against further green taxes\u201d concludes that \u201cGreen taxes are therefore already too high if they really are a means of internalising environmental externalities rather than simply revenue-raising measures.\u201d\nCorin Taylor, research director, commented that \u201cGreen taxes and charges impose substantial costs on, amongst others, northern manufacturers and the NHS. Green taxes in the UK are already well in excess of the level they need to be to meet the academic estimates of the social costs of carbon emissions.\u201d\nThe paper follows a recent YouGov poll in which 63% of those asked agreed with the statement \u201cPoliticians are not serious about the environment and are using the issue as an excuse to raise more revenue from green taxes.\u201d\nThe Treasury denied the claims, calling them ridiculous: \u201cThe government's definition of environmental taxes includes those taxes that are designed to primarily have an environmental impact - the climate change levy, aggregates levy and landfill tax.  In arguing against these taxes, the Taxpayers' Alliance are being doubly dangerous - it would mean cuts to public services, schools and hospitals, as well as higher carbon emissions leading to accelerated climate change.\u201d\nThe danger of a report such as this is not the fact that it may shake faith in the government or in taxation; it is the implication that pollution and environmental damage can be counterbalanced simply by spending.  The claim that ¢G11.7bn is enough to cover \u201cthe social cost of climate change to the world\u201d, such as weather changes and related disasters, is putting a price on something that can\u2019t be measured in purely economic terms: the health of our planet.\nWhilst industry may still cling to the idea that financing new technology will solve the problem of climate change \u2013 and whilst it may do so, in the future \u2013 in the present throwing money at the problems is not enough: we do not yet have the technology to \u201cundo\u201d environmental damage and therefore it is necessary to substantially alter our lifestyles if we want to minimise climate change.  As Friends of the Earth director Tony Juniper commented on the concept of carbon offsetting, \u201cCarbon offsetting schemes are being used as a smokescreen to avoid real measures to tackle climate change. We urgently need to cut our emissions, but offsetting schemes encourage individuals, businesses and governments to avoid action and carry on polluting.\u201d\nSources include: The Taxpayers Alliance report; Yougov; Friends of the Earth \nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.
