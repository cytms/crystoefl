Groups practicing both lifestyles still exist in today\u2019s world, so experts don\u2019t have to rely on fossils to investigate the matter. But until recently, only localized studies had provided support for the hypothesis.\nNow, anthropologist Noreen von Cramon-Taubadel at the University of Kent in England has conducted a global analysis, comparing skull and jaw shapes of 11 populations living in various parts of the world\u2014five with hunter-gather subsistence strategies and six with agriculture-based ways of life. She found that skull morphology has more to do with genetics than with food choices, finding little correlation among groups with similar habits.\nAs for the anatomy of the lower jaw, on the other hand, Cramon-Taubadel observed a strong dietary influence. In hunter-gatherer populations, people have long, narrow jawbones that give teeth plenty of breathing room. Members of agricultural societies, by contrast, tend to have shorter, smaller jaws that have trouble accommodating humans\u2019 relatively large choppers\u2014leading, it appears, to impacted wisdom teeth, overbites, crowding and other woes that land many of us in the dentist\u2019s chair on an all-too-regular basis.\nWhat accounts for the difference? Cramon-Taubadel\u2019s study highlights the possibility that hunter-gatherers give their lower jaws a workout\u2014and encourage their growth\u2014by chewing tough, unprocessed foods. People who rely on agriculture, meanwhile, tend to eat softer, cooked items that require less forceful gnawing, resulting in underdeveloped jawbones.\n\u201cChewing behavior appears to cause the lower jaw to develop differently in hunter-gatherer versus farming populations, and this holds true at a global level,\u201d said Cramon-Taubadel. \u201cWhat is interesting is that the rest of the skull is not affected in the same way and seems to more closely match our genetic history.\u201d\nThis explanation remains speculative, so those with dental problems shouldn\u2019t switch over to a raw diet just yet.
