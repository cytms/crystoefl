During the survey they found eight potentially new fish and one new coral species.\nPhoto: ? Conservation International/Gerald AllenPotentially new species identified during a 2011 Marine Rapid Assessment Program survey in Bali: Manonichthys \u2013 juvenile new dottyback\nTwo varieties of cardinalfish, two types of dottybacks, a sand perch, a fang blenny, a new species of goby, a garden eel, and a previously unknown Euphyllia bubble coral were among the species found and documented. Further study will be conducted to tell us more about the discoveries, scientifically speaking.\nPhoto: ?

These would ultimately consist of a network of ecologically interconnected and resilient areas.\nPhoto: ?

The most important finding, however, was that the reef system has been recovering since the 1990s.\nPhoto: ? Conservation International/Gerald AllenPotentially new species identified during a 2011 Marine Rapid Assessment Program survey in Bali: Meiacanthus \u2013 new fangblenny\n\"We carried out this present survey in 33 sites around Bali, nearly completing a circle around it, and were impressed by much of what we saw,\" said Dr. Mark Erdmann, senior advisor for the CI Indonesia marine program. \"There was a tremendous variety of habitats, surprisingly high levels of diversity and the coral reefs appeared to be in an active stage of recovery from bleaching, destructive fishing and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in the 1990s.\"\nPhoto: ? Conservation International/Mark ErdmannPotentially new species identified during a 2011 Marine Rapid Assessment Program survey in Bali: Siphamia \u2013 new cardinalfish\nOn the negative side, the RAP team discovered very few large fish or commercially important ones. Only three sharks and three Napoleon wrasse fish were found in 350 hours of diving when normally such numbers would be found in one dive. Plastic pollution was also an issue.\nPhoto: ?

Conservation International/Gerald AllenPotentially new species identified during a 2011 Marine Rapid Assessment Program survey in Bali: Grallenia \u2013 new goby\nThe CI team put together a number of recommendations, including which areas need attention right away, planning to reduce clashes between unsustainable fishing and marine tourism, and managing plastics and other pollution with strict measures.\nPhoto: ?

That is why it needs serious protection and management, to complete the revitalization.\"\nPhoto: ?

As always, until we take care of our oceans as well as land, many species will be lost to existence, some still unknown.","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"nature","title":"9 Unknown Species Found on Bali Reef","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/12492899518VN5u-Ljpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-9-potentially-new-species-found-bali-reef"}
