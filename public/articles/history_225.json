The Second Continental Congress was busy drafting a constitution known as the Articles of Confederation, seeking an alliance with France and supplying the war effort. But on June 14, 1777, it took time from its schedule to pass a resolution stating that \u201cthe flag of the United States be 13 stripes, alternate red and white\u201d and that \u201cthe union be 13 stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\u201d To this day, no one knows who designed the flag or why that particular color combination and pattern were chosen. Although legend holds that Betsy Ross made the first American flag in 1776 after being asked to do so by Washington, primary sources backing up that assertion are scarce.\nIt was almost unheard of for individuals to fly the U.S. flag until the Civil War broke out in 1861, at which time the Stars and Stripes suddenly became a popular symbol in the North, according to Leepson. \u201cThis is the beginning of what some people call the cult of the flag, the almost religious feeling that many Americans have for the red, white and blue,\u201d he said. In 1870 the Betsy Ross legend took off when her grandson held a press conference touting her possible role in sewing the first flag, and the earliest flag protection laws appeared not long after. Meanwhile, in 1885, Wisconsin teacher Bernard Cigrand originated the idea for a national flag day.\nIn 1912, President William Howard Taft signed an executive order that, for the first time, clarified what the flag should look like. Up until then, some flags were oddly proportioned, Leepson explained, or even had six- or eight-pointed stars. Four years later, President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation officially establishing a nationwide observance of Flag Day on June 14, the anniversary of the Flag Resolution of 1777. And in 1949, President Harry Truman signed legislation designating June 14 of each year as National Flag Day. Though Flag Day is not a federal holiday, the U.S. government encourages its citizens to display Old Glory outside of their homes and businesses. The tradition is not widely observed, however. \u201cTo most folks, unfortunately, Flag Day is not on their radar screen,\u201d Buss said.","author":"Jesse  Greenspan","web_category":"news","title":"A Flag Day History of the Stars and Stripes","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/american-flags-waving.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/a-flag-day-history-of-the-stars-and-stripes"}
