Necessary, but nonetheless damaging to the environment \u2013 especially when things go wrong. Despite this, there have been some serious innovations in recent years by our seafaring friends.\n5. Shark Skins on Freighters\nBelieve it or not, one of the major impediments to efficient movement at sea is the fantastic buildup of algae and barnacles on the underside of a ship. Hydrodynamics are destroyed, and the ability of the propeller to attain maximum traction in the water is reduced. The way around this in the past has been to scrape them off in dry-dock or with divers, or to use chemicals to kill them off. In the future, ships will use a \u201cshark skin\u201d of sorts that is rough to the touch, and which does not lend itself well to marine life.\nImage courtesy of eyeofscience.com\n4. Riding on a Cushion of Air\nUnlike an infaltible mattress, this technology is originally based on evading sonar detection. Riding on a sheet of tiny bubbles emitted through holes in the hull reduce the friction between the ship and the water, allowing the vessel to move at an increased efficiency. This is for the record, the same principle used by extremely fast torpedoes, only underwater it\u2019s called supercavitation.\nPhoto: Image from gcaptian.com\n3. Solar Sailors\nAs the rich continue to believe that yachts are a fantastic way to use their millions, it\u2019s probably for the best that there are ways to make luxury boats eco-friendly. These solar wings are able to be adjusted to all wind conditions, not so that they catch all of the wind, but so that they are always in prime position for the sun. The ships still feature conventional propellers, albeit driven by electricity, as opposed to oil or marine diesel and the technology is easily adaptable to ferries, among other small craft, as well as\u2026\nPhoto: Image from gcaptian.com\n2. Solar Sailor, Writ Large\nThis is the solar sailor technology in its most mature form. Three massive \u201csails\u201d grafted onto a supertanker, would reduce the energy consumption by up to 50%, although one is left to wonder with that sort of savings what, exactly, the tanker would be moving. The mock-up below is proposed to move potable water \u2013 obviously, a far better cause than crude oil.\nPhoto: Image from solarsailor.com\n1. Harnessing the Ocean\nThe Orcelle, a French design, is powered by solar energy, but propelled by a series of \u201cfins\u201d on the underside of the hull that capture the power of the ocean currents and waves. It also features a modified trimaran hull, a broad central area with two outriggers, and the propelling fins work as an underwater connector between the two surfaces. Wow. Just. Wow.\nPhoto: Image from solarnavigator.net\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
