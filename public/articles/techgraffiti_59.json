To some extent preparations have already begun: the record setting crude prices last week were propelled by Chinese stockpiling, but they may yet be insufficient.\nThe Chinese, are of course desperate to avoid the embarrassment of literally running out of power during the Olympic Games, especially in such times as now, where they will be hosting more free press than they have in their entire history. It\u2019s this fear that was responsible for last week\u2019s buying spree, and which may lead to an array of similar occurences as the games approach.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
