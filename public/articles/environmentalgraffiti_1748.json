If you weren\u2019t hungry before, you\u2019ll be famished after!\nUsing nothing else but food bought in his local supermarket, Carl creates these awesome landscapes with the help of food stylists and model-makers before painstakingly shooting each scene in layers.\nThe whacky masterpieces, which include a broccoli trees, a salmon sea, a garlic village and salami mountains, have to be precisely timed and planned to avoid the food wilting.\nThe only problem with making scenes like these is the waste. Carl told the UK\u2019s Telegraph: \"Although there is a fair amount of waste, there is a lot of food left over which is always shared out with the team, though most of the food used in the sets have either been superglued or pinned, and neither of these makes for good eating.\u201d\nThere are plans to turn the \u2018Foodscapes\u2019 into a book, which Carl hopes will encourage children to eat more healthily, even though he\u2019s still having trouble to get his kids to eat their greens. Well, how hard would it be to take orders from a father who still plays with his food?\nJust goes to show, art is all a matter of taste.\nWith special thanks to Carl Warner for use of his images. There are more cool shots on his website. \nHungry for more?
