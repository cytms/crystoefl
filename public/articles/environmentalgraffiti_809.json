Also known as Sasquatch, the creature is allegedly ape-like and said to inhabit the remote forests of northwest America and British Columbia, Canada. Yet, despite dozens of sightings there is still no definitive evidence that the elusive hairy being exists. Until now.\nSearching for Bigfoot, a company whose sole aim is to find Bigfoot has released teaser evidence that the creature is in fact real, or was.  Pictures of a deceased Bigfoot-esque animal found in northern Georgia have been released, along with some fascinating furry facts and figures.\n\nImage by: berniethomas68\nThe creature was discovered by Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, who are keeping the exact location a secret as they claim there are a whole troup of the animals still living. Tom Biscardi of Searching for Bigfoot has been a veteran Sasquatch tracker for years and traveled to Georgia to view the find last weekend. A team of scientists have been carrying out tests on the body and, along with the Tom Biscardi, they will release DNA and photographic findings to the media at a press release in Palo Alto, California, on Friday August 15, 2008 at 12 noon.\nGuess we only have to wait a day to find out if the whole thing is a hoax or not\u2026 again.\nSource 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
