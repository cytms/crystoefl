Image by Alma\n\nTherefore it\u2019s unsurprising that some people will do crazy things on the advice of these traditional medicine men, even if it\u2019s embarrassing or technically considered cruelty to animals and all sorts of gross. \nTake, for example, the case of Zoran Nikolovic, 35, of the Serbian capital of Belgrade. Zoran was so convinced in his witch doctor\u2019s advice that he had sex with a hedgehog when instructed to by the local healer. What was this supposed to heal, you ask? Premature ejaculation, of course. What else could possibly be cured by hedgehog sex?\nUnfortunately for our friend Zoran, the hedgehog was not exactly a willing partner, and those things are feisty. Nikolovic had to have emergency surgery after the encounter. On the plus side, it\u2019s entirely possible that the surgery will make it, ahem, more difficult for him to finish.\nNikolovic has not told his girlfriend yet, although I presume she\u2019ll find out pretty soon. He said: \u201cGod knows what she will think of me. I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s more likely to dump me for being some kind of pervert or for being such an idiot.\u201d\nHe added that he went to the witch doctor because \u201cI was so ashamed to go to a normal clinic to discuss sexual problems that I was ready to try anything. When the voodoo man suggested having sex with a hedgehog I walked out. But he guaranteed me total discretion and 100 per cent success so I decided to try it.\u201d\nWhile the witch doctor may have guaranteed discretion, the hospital apparently didn\u2019t. In what is likely the hospital spokesman\u2019s best day of work ever, he said: \u201cThe animal was apparently unhurt. The patient came off much worse from the encounter. We have carried out similar operations before, but only on people who have been in accidents. No one here has ever come across anything like it, and I doubt any of us ever will again.\u201d\nA few things to remember here. One, don\u2019t make out with animals. Animals are cool and don\u2019t want to make out with you, it\u2019s animal cruelty and they will bite you and such. Second, read that last quote again. Serbian hospitals have had to carry out these operations several times before after accidents. Apparently people there are accidentally hooking up with hedgehogs fairly regularly. Should you travel there, take protection and be careful when walking around outside.\nInfo from The Sun via Nothing to do with Arbroath(They're cool.
