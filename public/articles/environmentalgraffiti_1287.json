But when we have one of those lucid moments on viewing something special, seeing an awesome image and really taking notice of our world, it\u2019s then we stop and say, \"Wow!\"\nHere are some of those \"Wow!\" moments, captured forever so that we never loose sight of the color in our lives.\n\n\n1. The contrast and colors in this image are mind blowing; enough to make anyone stop in their tracks. Taken in Pelourinho, Salvador City, Brazil the vibrant sarongs, towel and t-shirts contrast really well with the brightly colored painted walls and doors of the houses. Pelourinho, in Salvador city, once had a dark past \u2013 Pelourinho means \u2018place to lash the slavors\u2019 \u2013 but now the area is better known as an arts and culture center.Photo: lapidim\n2. This awesome image was captured high on the plains of Ca?on del Colca, Peru. The photographer was surprised to see locals going about their everyday business in the relatively remote area, but they sounded as if they knew just where to go to get business. These children, posing with lambs, were demanding one Peruvian sol per photo (about 30 cents) from tourists there to view the canyon. Ca?on del Colca is one of the deepest in the world, said to be almost twice as deep as the Grand Canyon.Photo: Phillie Casablanca\n3. The convention center in Montreal is an eye-catching piece of architecture and has recently become one of the most photographed buildings in the city. Inside, when the sun shines, light floods the lobby in glorious Technicolor, creating an ephemeral gallery, and a pretty nice place to work. Although, after a few days of looking at that all day it\u2019s a wonder the receptionist don\u2019t go blind!Photo: caribb\n4. As much as we moan about it, isn\u2019t decay a wonderful thing sometimes? This old boat was found rusting away in a parking lot \u2013 yep, you read it right, a parking lot. It was being transferred to dry dock but was just at the right height for the photographer to capture this great textured image. The colors and composition are totally amazing. A worthy find.Photo: ecstaticist\n\n\n5. The glass sculptures of leading US designer Dale Chihuly have been exhibited in numerous museums worldwide.

This street is in South Hill, Virginia makes a small town look welcoming and cheerful, or a bit too in touch with their Disney side, depending on what way you look at it.Photo: eric st john\n7. Could a lake be any more colorful? It's an excellent shot but unfortunately, after much searching and toiling to find the original photographer, or any info on the image, we can't tell you much.

Protected by a small barrier from the public, this view of a Japanese maple tree in the Japanese Gardens, Portland OR, has been replicated many times, and each time it still looks amazing, especially if taken during fall. Photography in the gardens is so popular that the quick-thinking owners charge $2 for those entering with a tripod!Photo: ahp_ibanez\n9. Australians are a patriotic bunch, but this is going a bit far. Someone has painted the country\u2019s flag on their beach hut in Brighton beach, Melbourne. Or it could be to advertise the Commonwealth Games when they were there. Either way it certainly adds an oomph to the watery pastel shades in the background.Photo: pyjama\n\n\n1. India is often associated with vibrant colors. Their market stalls are always teeming with brightly colored powders for use in food and clothing, and once a year they celebrate their love of color during the spring Festival of Color, known as Holi. The festivities take place around March 21, beginning with the burning of an effigy of the demoness Holika. On the second day everyone across the country dresses in white before throwing colored powder and water on each other, a tradition that was once medicinal as the powders were made from certain herbs, but now it seems to be just one massive powder fight.Photo: marco bellucci\n2.

Tibetan art is very colorful and includes lots of bright primary colors as well as pastel shades.Photo: PePandora\n3. India is very often a mix of decadence and decay.

Bangles, dozens of them, are synonymous with India. They have great social, cultural and religious significance in the country, and are seen as the epitome of feminine grace.

All we know about these madly colored buildings is that they are in China somewhere, possibly. High rises are commonplace all over the country so it\u2019s a nice change to see a splash of color in the built-up areas.

The image shown here is one of the suburbs of the capital Genoa.Photo: tearsandrain\n2.

Visitors to these leather dyeing vats in Fez, Morocco often report a very distinct smell, that of animal flesh and ammonia. Nice. That\u2019s the only thing with photographs; you can\u2019t always get the full experience of a place. Maybe one day someone will invent the scratch \u2019n\u2019 sniff photo. But then again, maybe it\u2019s a good thing we can\u2019t always smell what we see in an image.Photo: jonkeegan\n4. Not your usual iconic image of Africa, that\u2019s for sure.

It would certainly brighten up a dull day.Photo: esti\n12. If there\u2019s one thing that is associated with British seaside resorts, it\u2019s candied rock.

What fun!Photo: robnwatkins\n\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
