Danger of losing the frozen ice that they need to hunt on. Climate change and global warming has already affected the Arctic \u2013 the break up of ice happens earlier each summer and floes are smaller which make it hard for bears get back to hunting land if caught on one. These changes also affect the bears\u2019 reproductive habits.

All of these changes are occurring whether it\u2019s Hudson Bay, the Barents Sea or Beaufort Sea. When asked what we can do to try and help stop this from coming to its inevitable tragic conclusion, McGrath says, \u201cIt will take serious energy policy change to slow the rate of climate change, which will have to happen at the policy level. We should all be doing what we can \u2013 those home and business energy savings practices we all know: drive less, turn off your lights and unplug your power cords when you're not using them, use compact fluorescent bulbs. But most important are the changes only governments can impose. So the one answer is: tell your representatives in no uncertain terms that regardless of your political leanings you want them to work toward responsible energy reform.\u201d You can read more about the bears and Susan\u2019s excellent article in the July issue of National Geographic, on news stands now.
