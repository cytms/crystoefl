The system\u2019s other bodies, dubbed 62b, 62c and 62d, are considered both too large and too close to the star to support life. The two outermost planets, however, fall within a more temperate \u201chabitable zone,\u201d meaning they\u2019re at a safe enough distance from the star to keep surface temperatures low and allow for the presence of liquid water\u2014critical to supporting life. Planets such as these are also known as \u201cGoldilocks\u201d planets\u2013not too hot, too cold, too large or too small, but \u201cjust right.\u201d\nScientists estimate that Kepler-62e, which has diameter 61 percent larger than Earth\u2019s and takes 122 days to orbit its star, would be by far the warmer of the two planets, with surface temperatures above 85 degrees Fahrenheit and warm and humid temperatures \u201call the way to the polar regions.\u201d Kepler-62f, 41% larger than Earth and with a longer orbit of 267 days, would be much colder, with average temperatures a frigid 19 degrees below zero. Both planets would be much cloudier than Earth, but would \u201cstill potentially be life-friendly,\u201d according to Dimitar Sasselov, a Harvard astronomer and co-author of the study.\nThe third planet, Kepler-69c, is much further away at 2,700 light years and is part of a two-planet system, with an orbit similar to our own Venus. Though scientists believe these three planets are the most likely candidates to support life in this system, they stress that much about them remains unknown. In fact, they haven\u2019t been able to actually see the planets themselves, but have instead relied on scientific data of the intergalactic bodies\u2019 movements transmitted by the space telescope. According the Ames Research Center, the telescope\u2019s findings show that the Milky Way is not at all unique in its makeup of stars and circling planets. In fact, scientists now believe that more than one-third of the stars outside our galaxy have planets of their own.\nYesterday\u2019s findings are not the first time the Kepler telescope has made history. In May 2009, NASA announced the discovery of Kepler-22b, located just 600 light years away in the constellation Cygnus, and the first known planet to lie within a \u201chabitable zone\u201d of a star like our own Sun. Two years later, the telescope helped scientists learn more about a previously discovered planet, TrES-2b (also known as Kepler-1b), which is now believed to be the darkest known exoplanet yet discovered, reflecting back less than 1 percent of the light that hits it. Earlier this year, data for the three-planet Kepler-37 system revealed one of the smallest planets ever discovered, Kepler-37b, only slightly larger than our moon. And in 2011, NASA scientists and Star Wars fans alike were stunned when the telescope helped confirm the existence of the first-known circumbinary planet, a planet that, just like the fictional planet Tatooine in the famous films, orbits not one but two stars.","author":"Barbara  Maranzani","web_category":"news","title":"New Super-Earths May Support Life","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/HITH-Kepler1.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/new-super-earths-may-support-life"}
