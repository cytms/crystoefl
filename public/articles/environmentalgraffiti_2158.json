Let me reiterate this:  in the middle of every snowflake there is a colony of living things.\nScientists were investigating how the snowflakes formed in the upper troposphere, where the temperature is approximately -40 degrees C/F  (celsius and fahrenheit are the same at that point), and ice has difficulty forming.  The answer:  biological catalysts.  The study in the journal Science examined snow from five sites worldwide to remove the possibility of the biologics being a local phenomenon. Despite some variation--imply what you will from France and America having the highest concentrations of these bacteria-- the Pseudomonas syringae were indeed present golbally.\nInfo from Ars Technia \nBy new Environmental Graffiti contributor Ben Ray.
