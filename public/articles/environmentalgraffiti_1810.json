Now, it's \"Go Barefoot Day.\"\nYes, in the proud tradition of Paul McCartney, who famously strolled loafer-less across Abbey Rd., HOK is asking their 2,500 employees to go barefoot on Earth Day as a conscious reminder of other ways to cut back.  The internal flyer, which is available here, stresses cutting back in your methods of transit and work habits-- virtual meetings instead of cross-country flights, mass transit instead of a carpool, even using your own mug for that morning trip to Starbucks.\nIt is wonderful to see such a large organization pick up the fight, even if only for one day, and especially one in an industry that's so well-positioned to do some good as HOK. Architects have an incredible capacity to advance the greening of society through their designs, even if it's one little (barefooted) step at a time.Environmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
