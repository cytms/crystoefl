No longer must we fear being crushed by a mammoth or gored by a saber-toothed tiger, but there are still many formidable fauna the modern person must face. Without further ado- the 7 deadliest animals of the modern world.\n7. Cats\nNot lions, you\u2019ll never come closer than the zoo, we mean housecats. With a clear disdain for humans and a nasty habit of dashing in front of you on the stairs, little Fluffy is a furball of death.\n\n6. Squirrels\n\u201cOhhhh, they\u2019re soooo cute. Quick, give that one a peanut. Here little OH MY GOD HIS BITE FEELS LIKE RABIES.\u201d   This tragic scene happens in thousands of parks across the world every single day.\n5. Dogs\nWe\u2019re not talking about the face tearing, child eating, fighting breeds. Just normal dogs. Studies have shown dogs are one of the best ways to meet members of the opposite sex, which leads to marriage, which is a kind of slow death.\n4.
