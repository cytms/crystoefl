The island\u2019s only town, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas (known locally as \u201cThe Settlement\u201d), is situated on the gently sloping volcanic base at the island\u2019s northern coast.\nThe population, consisting of 275 British citizens, is distinguished by only eight surnames and shares communal land, surviving only on subsistence farming (including potatoes and locally raised livestock), profits from the island\u2019s lobster factory and the sale of collectible postage stamps.\nPhoto: Michael Clarke Stuff\nWhile some may fantasize about a bucolic life on a forgotten island in the middle of nowhere, the realities of such an existence are decidedly more severe. The island is routinely battered by vicious South Atlantic storms, and Tristan\u2019s residents are under constant threat of famine, disease and volcanic catastrophe. In 1961, the island was temporarily evacuated due to an eruption that devastated the profitable crayfish canning factory and nearly covered the natural volcanic spring \u2014 the island\u2019s only freshwater source.\nPhoto: Michael Clarke Stuff\nToday, the island\u2019s inhabitants and infrequent visitors enjoy a unique array of flora and fauna, including seabirds such as the Northern Rockhopper Penguin and the Atlantic Yellow-Nosed Albatross. Scientific expeditions are routinely commissioned to study the wildlife here and on other islands in the Tristan da Cunha chain\nPhoto: Michael Clarke Stuff\nSocial forays are limited to Prince Phillip Hall, where residents and visitors stave off island fever with cool drinks and good times at The Albatross Bar.\nPhoto: Michael Clarke Stuff\nDespite being more or less marooned on a tiny rock surrounded by one of the world\u2019s meanest oceans and being subjected to debilitating endogamy and other island challenges, Tristan\u2019s small community of castaways manages to keep its spirits high while reveling in the title of the world\u2019s most isolated human settlement.\nSources: 1, 2","author":"TheJohn","web_category":"travel","title":"Tristan da Cunha: The Most Isolated Human Settlement on Earth","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb33.webshots.com-8352-2117529380104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-life-volcano-inside-world\u2019s-most-isolated-human-settlement"}
