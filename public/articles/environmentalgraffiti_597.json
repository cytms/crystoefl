I had never heard of Earth Day until watching the hilarious and silly film Bio-Dome. It's not celebrated here in the UK as much as it should be. Listening to Radio 1 this week has proved that some people out there can do things to help clean up the local environment. We can do that too.\nThere is a patch of shrubbery just outside my garden. While out hunting for one of my cats, I realised that this patch was strewn with rubbish. I know that the wind is very good at sending it off, but does it really hurt to pick up the odd crisp packet and put it in a bin? \nThe sun is shining now, the trees are in bloom, so let's help make summer cleaner by picking up our rubbish and getting rid of it properly.\nThis weekend, although Earth Day will have passed, I will be out in the bushes picking up other people's rubbish, so that when I look out of the window, I will no longer see carrier bags wrapped around tree branches, empty plastic bottles propped up against tree stumps and other litter on the floor. We don't generally have our homes in this state, why should outside be so different?","author":"Abatha","web_category":"nature","title":"Earth day Rubbish","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/1_tree_view_up.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/conservation/news-earth-day-rubbish"}
