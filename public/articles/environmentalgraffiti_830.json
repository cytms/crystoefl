Among the more controversial claims made at the state-of-the-art facility are that Adam and Eve's children were given an exemption from being susceptible to incest by God, and that dinosaurs lived peacefully with humans until the flood of Noah. The latter claim is displayed in especially ludicrous fashion-- velociraptors munch calmly on stalks of ferns as human children play behind them, and triceratops is featured with a saddle blanket and mount for a rider.\nThe museum has been the subject of criticism for obvious reasons, and from a multitude of scientific and cultural sources, but continues to be wildly popular among evangelical Christians--over 400,000 have visited in the last year.\n[Lexington Herald-Leader]\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
