Yes guys this is for real. Behold the Dog Powered Trike and bike!Photo: \nAccording to the Schutte, his inventions are the first urban dog-pulled devices. The best part is, that if your dog goes AWOL after those pesky cats \u2013 you\u2019ve got the ability to break and peddle with total control.\nThe dog doesn\u2019t need any special training, except for being comfortable with the scooter. The best way to get the nipper acclimatized (according to Schuette\u2019s site) is simply to strap the dog in and walk along side it for 20 minutes. \nWatch an awesome video of one of these contraptions in action:\nNext up apparently, is the dog-powered skateboard. Just strap in the hot dog.\nFor more information and where you can buy one of these supercool vehicles, check out Dog Powered Scooter.\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
