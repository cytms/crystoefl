According to his children, Darwin\u2014a doting family man at a time when active fathers were rare\u2014spoke these words to his wife Emma shortly before dying: \u201cI am not the least afraid of death. Remember what a good wife you have been to me. Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me.\u201d (Those who cared for him in his final moments later vehemently denied rumors\u2014largely circulated by a British evangelist who went by the name Lady Hope\u2014that the agnostic scientist had re-embraced Christianity and recanted his ideas about evolution on his deathbed.)\nDuring Darwin\u2019s lifetime, England\u2019s most prominent physicians failed to decode the ailing naturalist\u2019s jumble of symptoms. Their diagnoses ran the gamut from gout to appendicitis to hepatitis to mental exhaustion to schizophrenia, while the remedies they prescribed\u2014lemons, Indian ale, hydrotherapy, arsenic, strychnine and codeine, among countless others\u2014provided little relief.\nLast week, Darwin\u2019s health and death became the latest medical mystery tackled by the Historical Clinicopathological Conference (CPC), an annual event held by the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Since 1995, specialists have met to unravel the perplexing conditions of eminent figures who lived and died centuries or even millennia ago, using their advanced knowledge to retroactively diagnose these long-dead \u201cpatients.\u201d Past subjects have included Alexander the Great, Christopher Columbus, Edgar Allan Poe, Beethoven, Simon Bolivar, Claudius and the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten. Some of the conferences have sought more than just a diagnosis and cause of death, investigating, for example, if modern medicine could have saved Abraham Lincoln\u2019s life, what caused Florence Nightingale\u2019s debilitating depression and whether Joan of Arc was mentally competent when she stood trial for heresy.\nThis year, the case of Charles Darwin was taken up by Sidney Cohen, professor of medicine and director of research at the Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. It was an entirely new breed of challenge for the noted gastroenterologist, who usually relies on X-rays, blood studies and other types of physical evidence. \u201cThis is purely a symptom-based assessment, an analysis of this journey of invalidism that [Darwin] suffered throughout his life,\u201d Cohen said in a statement.\nIn his analysis, Cohen agreed with an existing theory that the scientist had likely contracted a parasitic illness called Chagas disease, possibly while traveling the globe\u2014and making observations that shaped his natural selection model\u2014aboard HMS Beagle. If left untreated, it can eventually cause cardiac damage. \u201cChagas would describe the heart disease, cardiac failure or \u2018degeneration of the heart\u2019\u2014the term used in Darwin\u2019s time to mean heart disease\u2014that he suffered from later in life and that eventually caused his death,\u201d Cohen explained.\nCohen also theorized, as have several other modern physicians, that a chronic condition known as cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) caused Darwin\u2019s lifelong abdominal distress. He then added a new diagnosis to the mix: Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium associated with peptic ulcers and stomach cancer, which is prevalent in the same regions as Chagas disease and is currently one of the most widespread infections on the planet, according to the World Health Organization. \u201cDarwin\u2019s lifelong history does not fit neatly into a single disorder based historically only upon symptom assessment,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI make the argument that Darwin had multiple illnesses in his lifetime.\u201d\nLike most of the historical figures the conference has evaluated, Darwin died before the diseases that plagued him were described and studied. \u201cIt is particularly poignant that the scientists and physicians of his time could not provide Darwin, the father of modern life sciences, with relief from the ailments that affected so much of his life,\u201d said Philip A. Mackowiak, vice chairman of the University of Maryland School of Medicine\u2019s department of medicine and the conference\u2019s founder. \u201cThis is precisely the type of historically significant mystery the CPC seeks to unravel. We hope examination of this case adds to the understanding and appreciation of this great man, who was able to accomplish so much despite his medical condition.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"What Killed Charles Darwin?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/charles-darwin-150x150.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/what-killed-charles-darwin"}
