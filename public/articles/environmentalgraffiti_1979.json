This is even after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to regulate the use of this chemical in many plastics.\n\nHigher BPA exposure has been reflected in higher urinary concentrations of BPA and may be associated with avoidable morbidity. This clearly suggests harm in great amounts to the human population.\nBPA can be found in many common household items, such as drinking cups, bowls and even eating utensils. Heating or even adding hot liquids to these items can cause the chemical to leech into the foods it holds.  \nPhoto: Stock.xchng\nMany believe that the agency has not proven that BPA is safe and some consider the agency made a \"rush to judgment\", while others say it\u2019s \u201ccompletely appropriate\u201d according to an article by Bryan Walsh called 'The Perils of Plastics' on September 2008.\nCountries like Canada are considering the regulation of BPA and a number of other manufacturers and retailers have promised to shift away from use of this plastic. \nCompanies like Eden Foods have already started to produce a bisphenol free product container to help limit the exposure many may be exposed to. \nTo avoid or limit your own exposure, avoid plastic containers that have the number (7) printed on the bottom. Never microwave your food in any type of plastic container and never wash these plastics in the dishwasher with detergents that are harsh and very hot water. This combination of hot water and detergent can cause BPA to be deposited on your other dishes and even glassware.Photo: Stock.xchng Stock Photo\nPlastics containing BPA can and have been recycled for years now and will still be recycled in future. Food items and plastics should never mix with containers that may contain BPA. If you are concerned about whether your containers could possibly contain BPA, contact the manufacturer of your product to be sure.","author":"Sh3lly","web_category":"science","title":"Bisphenol A: The Hidden Danger in Your Plastic Bottle","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb59.webshots.com-32954-2593707860105960926S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/health-and-body/news-still-confused-about-bpa"}
