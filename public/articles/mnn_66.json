O'Hare officials decided to go with goats over conventional mowers because they offer a more delicate and sustainable solution \u2014 they won't impact sensitive areas as much as heavy mowers would, they operate without creating net-positive CO2 emissions, and they'll leave behind fertilizer when they poop.\n?\nThe goats are owned by Butcher & Burger, a local burger joint/butchery and are destined to someday become food, but will, in the meantime, have some good years eating away at the fringes of an airport. Not a bad life for a goat.\n?\nHat-tip to my buddy Andrew for this one.\n?\nRelated on MNN: Global warming might mean more goats\n?\n?\nAre you on Twitter??Follow me (@sheagunther) there, I give good tweets.
