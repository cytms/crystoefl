But what can you say to the climbers who stick to \u201cleave no trace\u201d practices as they scale the giddy heights \u2013 not to mention the adrenaline junkies who \u201cfree solo\u201d with no self-protective measures at all? These crazy cats not only feel the rush of defying gravity \u2013 and hopefully death; they also get to see some of the world\u2019s most stunning natural scenery and amazing natural rock formations \u2013 all from an aerial perspective few can fathom.\nPhoto: Agulha do Diabo\nIn memory of free soloing legend Dan Osman, who died in 1998, travel loving website Hotnez has compiled a dizzying photographic tour of The 15 Most Spectacular Rock Climbs on Earth. Alongside scenic heart-stops like the sandstone rock pillars overlooking the monasteries of Greece\u2019s Meteora are topographical high spots such as Dead Horse Point, featured in the opening scene of Mission Impossible. \nPhoto: Mount Roraima\nAmerica's national parks supply a number of the more familiar geological wonders, Canada and Pakistan chip in with some snow-capped hair-raisers, while Europe offers alpine rockface favourites such as the Matterhorn. But it\u2019s South America that seems to take the breathtaking biscuit, with marvels like Agulha do Diabo (\u2018Devil\u2019s Needle\u2019) in Brazil, and Mt. Roraima \u2013 which forms the border between three countries \u2013 almost beggaring belief.\nPhoto: Cerro Torre, Patagonia, Argentina\nRead more and view all the pictures at: Hotnez\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
