The boy, for his trouble, was rewarded with a large red  welt, and several puncture marks.  Despite this, he was judged to not need medical treatment, and spared the excitement and expense of an ambulance ride.\nThe hedgehog, who was an innocent bystander in all of this, was in dead at the time it was collected by police officers as evidence, but it is unknown if it was living or dead at the time that Mr. Singhalargh lost his bearing and judgment.\nHe has been arrested for assault with a deadly weapon - but as of yet no animal cruelty statutes have been invoked.\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/teaserbigstockGardenWarblerSylviaBorin8142568jpg_1","title":"Man Uses Hedgehog As Deadly Weapon","author":"whatsrequired"}
