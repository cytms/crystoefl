Most recently he was asked to judge a design competition that would see a range of new bike racks designed specifically for New York City. A keen cyclist himself, Byrne was so taken by the idea that he submitted a few creations of his own.\nThe designs, made from the same square metal tubing used in ordinary bike racks, attempt to encapsulate and define various New York neighborhoods: a dollar sign sits on the walkway outside Wall Street; an electric guitar decorates the path in Williamsburg and in Brooklyn, a car near the entrance of the Lincoln Tunnel.\nDavid Byrne hopes that by integrating cycling with art cyclists will be seen as slightly cooler. He says, riding a bicycle “used to be completely uncool… now it’s cool in different ways: for some people it’s cool if you have an old junker, for other people it’s cool if you have a racing bike. Anyway, it doesn’t immediately relegate you to nerd status anymore.”\n ","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/NY1_0.jpg","title":"Wow...Check Out this Rack!
