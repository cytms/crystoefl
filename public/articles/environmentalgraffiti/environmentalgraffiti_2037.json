Dr. Andrews, who took this amazing image, says: \"It's really critical to understand how cancerous cells multiply and take over.\"\nAmazed? Since 1974, the Nikon International Small World Competition is held annually. Microphotographers gather from all around the world to participate. Some photos, you'll find are best in advance science and some are so amazingly beautiful and interesting, you would love to see them again and again.  \n \nMr. Stringer, who took the photograph above, gathers one of the most common types of phytoplankton, called diatoms. Though he is not a microscopist, he is very well aware of how to dress up the diatoms by manipulating the image and hence creating wonderful photomicrographs.\n \nGerd Guenther is an organic farmer by profession in Duesseldorf, Germany. As part of his work, he loves to explore the beautiful world of soap bubbles and plants under the microscope.\n \nYanping Wang is a screenwriter by profession. She chose this microphotograph of Chinese soy sauce because she found that it resembles a human face.\n \nHave you ever seen an Ichneumon wasp compound eye magnified 40 times? This amazing photo was taken by Charles Krebs, who is a professional photographer with a specialization in small insects.\nThis rare image of a mollusc baby was taken while it was swimming like a scallop by clapping its shells together. Dr. Rouse is a marine biologist, who as a part of his awareness program uncovers the hidden wonders in the sea sand.\n \nJames E. Hayden is from the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, USA, who came up with the idea of looking at the autofluorescence of tissue in two colors. This is a great photomicrograph of developing oocytes (unfertilized eggs) as they move along the spiral of an anglerfish's ovary. \n \nDr. Heiti Paves finds anthers a good subject because \"they do not move very fast.\" He took this shot of Arabidopsis thaliana, which is a commonly used plant and serves as a model in scientific research. It is also the first plant to have its genome fully sequenced.\nWhile studying an atypical carbon nanotube growth run, Paul Marshall took this image. It is a rare microscopic beauty of a 'forest' of carbon nanotubes.\nAs a part of his graduate thesis, Michael Hendricks captured this image showing the anatomy of a 3-day-old embryonic zebrafish brain, trying his best to show the details of the brain structure.\nUsing the technique of laser confocal microscopy, Albert Tousson shot a rare image of the cross-section of a lily of the valley plant. Here the cell walls are shown in red. The parts shown in yellow and green are the starch granules.\nSo how did you like the unseen world of ours through a complex but beautiful life? Seen through a light microscope, these stunning images are a very important scientific contribution to the life sciences, bio-research and materials science. \n\n","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb64.webshots.com-27263-2817095160105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"The Hidden Photographic World of Micrographs ","author":"Alka Sharma"}
