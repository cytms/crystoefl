{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/green-living/two-thousand-trees/113","content":"\nThere won’t be that many posts over the next few days as we at environmental graffiti are heading off en masse to the Two Thousand Trees Festival in Sunny Gloucestershire.  As the name suggests, Two Thousand Trees is about environmental and ethical living as well as music.  Alongside fantastic up and coming artists is a nature walk around the beautiful Cotswolds farm.  \nThe festival is new this year, set up by the guys from Truck, England’s best ‘boutique’ festival and numbers are limited to 2000.  Big acts headlining include Frank Turner and INME.\nAnyway, we’ll be there with our tent and our stall, spreading the word about environmental graffiti and reporting from what looks like the best eco/music event around this summer.\n","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb24.webshots.com-44055-2359028470104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Two Thousand Trees","author":"Chris"}
