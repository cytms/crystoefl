But the locals don't run from this giant tourist draw. They climb towards it. This time of year, you see, is when they feed the volcano.\nThe annual festival of Yadnya Kasada is observed by the Tenggerese people of Indonesia in remembrance of the legend of Roro Ateng, an historic Queen. Mythology holds that Roro Ateng bargained with the great volcano for fertility, promising to repay its gift of children with the sacrifice of her youngest offspring.\nEach year, pilgrims journey to the top of Bromo to appease the great stratovolcano with whatever meager offerings they have, including food, animals, and money. They offer their sacrifices and prayers for happiness and good health, and that the mountain gods won't send rivers of lava raining down the ancient slopes.\nThe disenfranchised of East Java don't have to wait long for their prayers to be answered. The poorest among them gather during the month-long festival and await the sacrificial day. For, as the others shower gifts into the crater, geophysics won't let those gifts stay for very long. With fishing nets and blankets at the ready, the Javanese poor collect the gods' rejects and head home a little richer than before.\nThe festival, held unfailingly since the 15th century, guarantees a small, but reliable, cash bonus to a few lucky Javanese each year.\n","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/potatoes_cheese.jpg","title":"Yadnya Kasada: The Javanese Volcano Festival","author":"mysterix"}
