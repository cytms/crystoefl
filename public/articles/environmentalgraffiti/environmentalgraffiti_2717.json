Built on stilts to overcome the milder floods, and it’s easy and cheap to erect a new one if yours suddenly disappears into the local ‘stream’.\nThe time has come for the average Briton to realise his/her Bangladeshi dream – a waterfront house, a boat, a suntan, It’s all very exciting, I feel the Buddhist inside me stirring.\n Fabulously the Co-Operative Bank is sponsoring this venture, easing the way to your Bollywood paradise. And if you’re flash enough to have a spare bit of garden, field, lawn, Living Space 21 will happily buy that land from you to sell in conjunction with the stilted houses.\nLuckily for the happy house buyer your stilted paradise is also an eco-friendly haven, built from timber frames sourced from sustainable forests, rainwater capture facilities and sloped roofs to maximise solar efficiency – not only is a cheap alternative to a two-up two-down in the centre of town, it’s also more energy efficient and sustainable to run – yippee!","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/sleeping_rudy.jpg","title":"Co-operative Living","author":"emma"}
