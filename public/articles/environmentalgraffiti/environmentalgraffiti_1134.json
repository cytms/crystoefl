President Lula said the drop in deforestation had prevented the release of 410m tonnes of greenhouse gases and the destruction of 600,000 trees.\nPaulo Moutinho, co-ordinator at the Environmental Research Institute of the Amazon, told Reuters that rising commodity prices this year could fuel renewed destruction: if the price of crops rises, incentive increases for illegal loggers to clear forested areas for planting.\n“Awareness and policies improved in the federal and state governments, but the real test is if rates fall during a commodity price rally.” ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Python1.jpg","title":"Amazon rainforest destruction slows","author":"Maryking"}
