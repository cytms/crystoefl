Environmental artists have a knack of presenting their works in natural habitats, which makes us think more about the fragility of the planet, especially when their pieces decay or change over time. And some artists share their ideas of the planet through installations within an exhibition space.\nThis year sees the \n (MCASD), in conjunction with the University of California Berkeley and Pacific Film Archive, present a number of exhibits that focus on the natural world.\nAs part of collaborative multi-year exhibition project, entitled \n, eight prominent artists were sent to eight \n sites “to create new work informed and inspired by their experiences in these diverse cultural and natural regions.” Mark Dion, Ann Hamilton, Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle, Marcos Ramírez Erre, Rigo 23, Dario Robleto, Diana Thater and Xu Bing were commissioned to create works based on how they responded to a specific site. Their interpretations offer a glimpse into some of the world’s most amazing locations, and allow us to see how someone else might view our changing planet.\nTheir works are on display in the museum’s downtown Joan and Irwin Jacobs Building and 1001 Kettner galleries until February 1, 2009.\nSources \n, ","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/campgroundjpg","title":"Incredible Displays of Environmental Art","author":"Linda"}
