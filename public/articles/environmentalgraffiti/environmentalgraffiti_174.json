But what \n cinnamon, and where does it come from?\nCinnamon spice is made from tree bark. Two species of the cinnamon tree are most common, and provide most of the spice sold worldwide. The spice from \n has a stronger taste and dark brown colour. This version of the spice is popular in the United States. \"True\" cinnamon is a common term for the \n, a native of Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Its spice is sweeter in flavour.  \nSeveral of the less common species in this family are: \n and \n of Indonesia; \n from Australia; \n of Papua New Guinea; and \n from India.\nThe Cinnamon tree is a member of the \n family, which includes the avocado and the California bay leaf, among some 2,000 species in total. Most are woody trees and shrubs. The Cinnamon tree is evergreen.\nSri Lanka supplies about 70% of the world's demand for \"true\" cinnamon; its major importer is Mexico. Cassia cinnamon is grown in China and a few other countries.\nCinnamon is mainly propagated by seeds, although a plantation may plant cuttings as well. A hardy plant, it grows well in loam or sandy loam. The best bark comes from trees in sandy soil, although loam provides more rapid growth and higher yields.\nCinnamon tolerates wet through semi-dry conditions in Sri Lanka. Daytime temperatures should remain in the 20-30 degree Celsius range.\nUnlike most trees that supply food for people, the cinnamon tree's \n is dried to become the spice. This is most obvious in cinnamon \"sticks\", which are simply rolled-up strips of dried cinnamon bark. Some studies find more health benefits from cassia, however.\nPowdered cinnamon spice, therefore, is ground-up dried tree bark. Some people prefer the sweeter taste of \n over \n.\nIn Sri Lanka, cinnamon can be dried simply by hanging rolled strips of bark from ceiling rafters. The long strips are later cut to the familiar cinnamon stick size, or ground into powder.\nCinnamon can be sprinkled onto cereal or bread. Cinnamon sticks mull wine or hot fruit drinks in cold Canadian winters. Finally, it is a popular baking ingredient, especially in cinnamon buns.\n:\nHeli J.
