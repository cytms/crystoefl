According to local media reports in the country, the poster manufacturer has said the photographed tiger’s \"stripes, bearing and motion are exactly the same as the New Year's poster.\" \nInternet users believe that Zhou Zhenglong, the farmer from Zhenping county, a mountainous part of northern Shaanxi province, used digital photo altering technology to produce the image. They accuse Chinese local wildlife authorities, who authenticated the picture, as saying it was real to boost tourism. \nAlthough Environmental Graffiti has been unable to obtain the two images, Reuters has reported that the two tigers do look very similar. \nThe government has launched a search for evidence of living tigers in the wild following the photograph. The tiger once had more than 4,000 individuals in the wild, but destruction of habitat and hunting had reduced its numbers allegedly to extinction.  Shaanxi provincial governor Yuan Chunqing said: \"Regarding the South China tiger, there will be a result soon. The investigation ... is necessary, and the government is right to encourage it.” \nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Tiger_in_the_water.jpg","title":"Was A Recent Photo of an Allegedly Extinct Tiger a Digital Hoax?","author":"Chris"}
