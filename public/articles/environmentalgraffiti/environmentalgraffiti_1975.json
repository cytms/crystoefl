This wasp preys on the silverleaf whitefly, as well as on the papaya whitefly.\nThe silverleaf whitefly eats tomato leaves, and may infect the plant with the tomato yellow leaf curl virus. Agricultural control of silverleaf whitefly commonly requires insecticide to prevent damage to the tomato crop.\nIt is actually the wasp larvae that kill either species of whitefly. The mother wasp lays an egg inside an immature whitefly. Upon hatching, the larva eats its host from the inside.\nThe role of the papaya plant is to act as a ‘reserve bank’ of papaya whiteflies. This attracts the wasps, bringing them close enough to the tomato vines to detect their alternative prey.\nSince the papaya whitefly does not eat tomatoes, there is no risk that the farmer would face a double attack upon the tomatoes.\nThis approach seems to work well in Florida, particularly in greenhouses. It is \n expected to completely eliminate insecticide use, but certainly reduces the need for them, while increasing the effectiveness of other pest control measures.\nSince other states prohibit the import of papaya whiteflies, this solution might be limited to the Sunshine State.\n:\nRobert H.
