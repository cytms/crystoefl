After all, birds use a broad palette in colouring their plumage. What do they see?\nThe researchers found that, in the retina of birds, some of the cone cells are sensitive to light in the ultraviolet band.\nBirds' plumage does not include ultraviolet \"colours\". This leaves researchers puzzled by the question, \"How \n birds use their ultraviolet vision?\"\nThe research paper also expresses surprise that birds' plumage only covers \"26 to 30 percent\" of the shades and hues they are capable of seeing. The researchers wonder whether birdsâ€™ feathers will someday produce more colours (perhaps to aid in mate selection).\nThis author speculates that the avian UV eyesight might be advantageous for avoiding predators, or in finding food or shelter. Reindeer, for example, use their UV vision in winter both to find lichen for food, and to spot and avoid wolves' urine markers (as reported in \"\n\").\n:\nScience Daily, \"\n\", which was based on \"M.
