She has everything she needs to make it happen — a body, a burial site, and a biodegradable coffin.\nThe Natural Burial Company will begin to sell a variety of eco-friendly \n products when it opens in January, including the \n, a kayak-shaped coffin made out of recycled newspapers.\nThe \n, is made in the \n from naturally hardened, 100% recycled paper.

Eco-friendly burials have been popular in Britain for years, but industry experts say it's starting to catch on in the U.S., where \"green\" cemeteries hosting natural burials have sprouted up in California, Florida, New York, South Carolina and Texas.\nThe market is potentially huge.

Industry experts say eco-friendly funerals are just an extension of such personalised end-of-life planning.\nBiodegradable containers cost from around $100 for a basic cardboard box up to more than $3,000 for a handcrafted, hand-painted model.
