The UK firm's modern twist on the camper van has resulted in a compact, earth-friendly floating home that efficiently uses the sun's rays as its power source. Melting glaciers or not, owners can rest assured that the SolarHome will provide shelter enough to survive on the water for up to a year at a time in Self Sufficient Mode. The home is also designed with the option to dock in a mobile floating home community (just like a park for camper vans) outfitted with infrastructure for power, fresh water and sewage treatment.\nDesigned with nature in mind, the SolarHome is just one example of how Kingsley Architects are dedicated to upholding sustainable and energy efficient practices in their work:\nThe SolarHome allows for ample views of the surrounding environment from almost anywhere within its small, 75 square metre frame. The little house on the water features an open-air kitchen/living area and enclosed sleeping areas in the back.\nInterested in living in one of these? The proposed prototype mobile floating home community would be located in the Lusatian Lakelands in Germany.\nIf you think the SolarHome is cool, you'll probably like this house by \n too.\n","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb20.webshots.com-45715-2067462300105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Floating Solar House by Kingsley Architects","author":"soniaydong"}
