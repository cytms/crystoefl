This is also a factor in Sardinia,  where a large Catholic population fuels one of the \"Blue Zones\" and lives far longer than the average Italian.\nJapan possesses an overwhelming sense of purpose,  Buettner reports, and the concept has a name: ikigai.  Loosely translated, it means \"that which makes one's life most worth living.\"  It strikes him then, as no coincidence that Okinawa has the longest disease-free life expectancies in the world.\nLow-intensity activity does a phenomenal job of keeping the body in working order without placing too much stress on an aging system: getting out an walking, or enjoying some form or recreation also contributes to a sense of independence that allows the mindset needed for the other points to flourish.\nFamily, like the previous item, helps develop support structures, as well as an essential mindset of caring; Buettner simply states that he's never met a mean centenarian.\nFinally, yes, there is one essential oddity-- a diet that's drastically different from that of most Americans.\nConsistently, Buettner reports people eating small portions and not much meat in their diets. This accounts for the widespread success outside of the United States, especially in places like Italy, Japan, and Costa Rica, where culture has embraced a different style of cooking.","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/the-peacefulman.jpg","title":"Five Secrets to Live To 100","author":"whatsrequired"}
