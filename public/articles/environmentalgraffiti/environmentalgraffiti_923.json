The unmarked package--further proof that if you are smuggling dinosaur fossils, you should always mark them with something, even if it's just \"not illegal fossils\"-- represents a species that has never been found in the region of the country that recovered it, indicating a misidentification or, potentially, the laundering of these smuggled fossils.  \nThis is by no means a new phenomenon; Yale University, alma matter of George W. Bush, agreed to return a \n last fall that they had held for nearly 100 years. \nThe Peruvians, to their credit, are stepping up their efforts to keep their national treasures home-- the Yale case broke open under threat of a lawsuit, and seizures in 2007 \n.\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/islgoogjpg","title":"The n00b's Guide to Concealing a 19 Pound Triceratops Jawbone ","author":"whatsrequired"}
