They’re also rather yummy.  Delicious raw but you can add them to American pancakes, shove them in the batter about half way through cooking.  Also good with cheesecake.\n(or egg plants) are one of the most versatile vegetables out there.  They’re native to the Mediterranean, but grow most places vaguely temperate.  Traditionally, people salt them before cooking but it isn’t really necessary.  They’re good just grilled with olive oil or you can try to make baba ghanoush.  It’s sort of like an aubergine houmus and easier than it sounds, honest!  Grill aubergines for about 40 minutes, allow to cool, then peel.  Whiz in blender with garlic, olive oil, tahini paste and lemon juice.","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Vitaminwater.jpg","title":"Tastes of Summer","author":"tom lyttelton"}
