There have been 32,000 cases this year in this area alone - that says malaria is very much present.\" He added that \"now we are not talking about eradicating malaria any more, as that is impossible and unsustainable; we are doing our best to try and control it.\"\nClimate change is causing the revival of the disease. Out of season rain is leaving puddles containing infected larvae in previously unaffected areas. Logging is also to blame. Cutting down trees spreads the mosquitoes and their larvae to new areas. \nScientific studies have shown a link between deforestation and malaria in the past.  A recent Peruvian study showed that mosquitoes in deforested areas were 300 times more likely to bite than mosquitoes in unlogged areas.  The majority of the victims are the loggers themselves. Malaria victims in the Amazon are at a particularly high risk.  There are very few health clinics in the Amazon even in heavily populated areas.\nSource: ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Global-Warming-effectsjpg","title":"Malaria No Longer Eradicated Thanks to Global Warming","author":"Chris"}
