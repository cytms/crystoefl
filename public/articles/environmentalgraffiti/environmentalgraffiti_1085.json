According to ornithologists, the last time this occurred was 1993.  \nThe winter of 1993 was particularly bad, and was characterized by excessively cold temperatures and heavy snowfall. The snowfalls preceded heavy floods.\nRoyal Society for the Protection of Birds ornithologist Davey Fitch said: “Their arrival may be a signal of a lack of food in Eastern Europe and also of a cold winter.”\nBelieve it or not, finches are actually the second usual indicator of a cold winter by birds. The first is the early arrival of pink-footed geese, who flee unusually cold conditions in their summer feeding areas in Greenland.\nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/eye-winkjpg","title":"Cold Winter is For the Birds","author":"Chris"}
