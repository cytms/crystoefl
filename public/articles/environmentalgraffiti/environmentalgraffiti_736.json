Yes, these humble crustaceans with the funny walking style make beautiful pictures out of sand. We’ve all seen them. Time to inspect how and why of this mysterious art works. \nCrabs can be found in all the oceans around the world and one particular family, namely the sand bubbler crab (\n), are especially familiar because most of us will have admired their intricate artworks made out of little sand balls at a visit to the beach.\n\nImage: \nSand bubblers can be found along the shores of the Indian and Pacific Oceans but also at beaches from East Africa to Hawaii, especially along Asian and Australian coastlines.\n\nImage: \nAt low tide, the sand bubbler crabs emerge from their holes beneath the sand to gather microscopic food that the tide has brought along. They do this by collecting and sifting the sand, actually checking each grain, and rolling those parts devoid of anything useful for them into little balls (sand bubbles) that they toss behind. \n\nImage via \nSo, the little sand balls are actually cleaned parts of sand, rolled into a ball so that the crab doesn’t check them again by mistake. Pretty clever, isn’t it? \n\nImage: \nAnd we can’t even state that the waste we leave behind looks even half as pretty. Enjoy the following amazing crab art designs.  \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage via \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nAnd finally, we don’t want to leave you in the lurch as to how crabs actually manage to roll those sand balls. Here’s an awesome video of a sand bubbler crab rolling sand balls at a beach in Thailand. It starts slow but the action picks up after about one and a half minutes when the sand ball production gets going. A must-watch on stressful days!\n\n\nSo the next time you stumble upon cool designs by crab artists, quickly get your camera as come the next tide, they will be washed away forever. \n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/crab14.jpg","title":"Close Encounters of the Crab-Ball Kind","author":"Simone Preuss"}
