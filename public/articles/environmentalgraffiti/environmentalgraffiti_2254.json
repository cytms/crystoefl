Not just airplane parts, or the \n, but \n, too, and anything else up there.\nThe answer, as it turns out, it a whole lot.  Well, airplane parts and poo, no, but meteorites, yes-- hundreds every day.  The fact of the matter is, there are a lot of rocks in space, and as Earth waltzes through orbit, we encounter them every second of the day.  Most of them burn up however, and don't give us the opportunity to be terrorized as they come streaking down from the heavens and blow up our car.\nTo give you an idea of how protective our atmosphere is, a meteor entering it would have to be larger than 50M across to make it to earth's surface. Any larger, though--75M or so-- and they can strike with the force of an atomic bomb.  Of course, these only come up every 1,000 years or so, and there was \n, so we may yet be safe.","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb43.webshots.com-4394-2558880870103830173S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"How Often Is The Sky Falling?","author":"whatsrequired"}
