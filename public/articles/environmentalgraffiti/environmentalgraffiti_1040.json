The reserve covers nearly 125,000 acres of \n and \n that has been the winter home of the \n for thousands of years. Calderon intends to promote \n to the area to help stop illegal \n.\nThe reserve already receives almost $37 million from the US \n. Armed and armored park rangers roam the area in search of illegal logging. It has been somewhat successful recently, with a 48% drop in illegal logging this year.\nEnvironmental experts say illegal logging threatens the delicate \n, although they are not an endangered species.  Lincoln Brower, professor emeritus of zoology at the University of Florida, said: \"By even taking a single tree out near the butterfly colony, you allow heat to escape from the forest, and that then jeopardizes the butterflies.\"\nBower argues that while monarchs are not threatened with extinction, \n destruction can threaten the insectsâ€™ migration. He said: \"The whole migratory phenomenon, which involves two continents and over a million square miles [2.5 million square kilometers], could just go down the drain.\"\nThe monarch butterfly migration has been described as a natural wonder. Butterflies fly south from the US and \n sometime in September and return to Mexico, sometimes to the specific tree they visited the year before.\nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/bf12.png","title":"Mexicans Fight to Save Monarch Habitat","author":"Chris"}
