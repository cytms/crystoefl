The majestic mountain in the southern part of the country is a protected rainforest where the variety of flora and fauna abounds. This is a home for the Philippine eagle, the country’s biggest raptor, now an endangered specie.\nIn the early 90s, even the foothills of Mt. Apo used to be covered by a lush second growth forest. Environmental degradation brought by human activities in the area rapidly consumed towering trees. It was once a mountainous paradise but now a rolling flatland plantation of pineapples and bananas. The devastation caused by illegal logging, upland migration and agricultural expansion brought massive soil erosion and regular flashfloods, especially during rainy seasons in the country. Without trees, there was nothing to hold the rushing water coming from the slopes of the mountain when heavy rain comes.\n \n    ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb58.webshots.com-45177-2746310540104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Saving the Philippine Rainforests of Mt.
