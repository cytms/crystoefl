It is also a mystical place of wild rivers, waterfalls and cave systems.\nA rainforest that is so impenetrable in parts that it is viewed as the only place the, elusive or extinct (take your pick), Tasmanian Tiger or \nmay still roam.\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Tarkine covers 447,000 hectares and on a global scale contains one of the most significant tracts of temperate rainforest. Temperate rainforest is regarded as the rarest of rainforests. It is more threatened than tropical and subtropical rainforests. \nInside the rainforest it has been likened to a cathedral. \nA silent, cool place where shadowy light plays on the trunks and forest floor which is carpeted with mosses and lichens. Bright coloured fungi and native orchids can also be found here.\nThe Tarkine is also a refuge for many species of fauna that are regarded as rare, threatened or vulnerable such as quolls, wedge tailed eagles and giant freshwater lobsters. It also contains the only population of Tasmanian Devils not affected by the facial cancer. Trekkers visit the area to search for a glimpse of the endangered orange bellied parrot, the white bellied sea eagles and the platypus that swim in the rivers. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nThe Tarkine National Coalition continues to lobby for the area to be\n\ndeclared a World Heritage Area and National Park.\n\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb28.webshots.com-43931-2477950170103830173S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"The Hidden Wonders of Tasmania's Tarkine Rainforest","author":"sontag"}
