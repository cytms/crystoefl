Scientists are less concerned about the amount of CO2 released by burning plants however.\nWildfires are a natural part of the ecosystem, and CO2 emissions from the fires are part of the natural cycle. In addition, CO2 from wildfires is actually less harmful than that of fossil fuels.\nAbout 290 million tons of CO2 emissions are released from fires. This is equivalent to 4%-6% of the emissions produced by fossil fuels in the US.
