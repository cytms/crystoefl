Let’s enjoy these stunning water tapestries found in our backyards.\nDew is easily caught in spider webs because it attaches to thin, exposed objects not warmed by ground sources. The surface of the spider’s web cools by radiating its heat while the moisture in the atmosphere condenses at a rate greater than it can evaporate, resulting in the formation of water droplets in the form of dew or rain.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/2786710020df2ee3eddbzjpg","title":"20 Amazing Water Webs","author":"Simone Preuss"}
