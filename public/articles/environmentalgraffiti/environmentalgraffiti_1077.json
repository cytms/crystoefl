The report is an emergency survey commissioned following the extinction of the tiger in the Sariska reserve in Rajasthan, the result of poaching gangs. The report will show that the number of tigers in the wild has dropped sharply.\nThe plan to hire soldiers follows reports of problems in Indiaâ€™s Forest Service, where a lack of staff has resulted in poaching gangs operating with impunity. Soldiers, with knowledge of tracking, weapons, and enforcement, were seen as an effective, if not ideal, solution.\n\"It is not a 'magic bullet,\" said Belinda Wright, a leading conservationist, \"But we believe the former soldiers can make a valuable contribution to protecting the most charismatic mammal on the planet. The entire world is now watching India to see how we deal with this crisis.\"\nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-i42.tinypic.com-wsqo7r.jpg","title":"Retired Soldiers Enlisted To Battle Poachers","author":"Chris"}
