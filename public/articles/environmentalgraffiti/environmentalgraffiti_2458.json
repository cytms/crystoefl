Of course there are some electronic devices you can not turn off at the mains, for example alarm clocks, fridges, freezers but nearly all other electrical appliances can be switched off at the mains when not in use, this not only saves the planet but also your money!\nWhile cordless phones may be the norm today, the power consumption on these is surprisingly large and if you switch these off at the mains you will not be able to make or receive calls, which defeats the purpose of a phone. The old-fashioned cordless telephones do not take any power from the mains and while you may think it may be less convenient to be attached by a cord to your telephone think how many times you use your cordless phone sat down next to the base, or how many times you put the phone down somewhere and loose it, this won't happen with a corded device.\nObviously don't drive unless you have to, or try and car-share but if you must drive, then gradually accelerating and braking saves a lot more energy then you would first think. If you think about it, it is pretty obvious; by accelerating suddenly you are using a lot of fuel, by then suddenly braking, you are stopping that fuel from achieving its potential. By gradually accelerating, picking up momentum slowly, it does not require as much effort to stop.\nThere are probably more green companies out there than you think, search the web for green alternatives to everything from \n to chocolate - Green and Blacks chocolate, for example, is organic, fair-trade and carbon neutral.\nTumble dryers use a lot of power; drying your clothes outside on a clothes line uses no power, your clothes will also smell fresher. Obviously, you can't dry your clothes outside all the time due to weather conditions, but if it's raining/snowing/hailing, you can always dry your clothes on a clothes horse inside - it may take longer but it still works. Again, not only will this help the planet but also your bank account.","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/tv.jpg","title":"5 Everyday Steps to a Greener Life","author":"EdConway"}
