These animals all have polycephaly: the condition of having two heads.\nThese ‘conjoined twins’ although different are locked within the same operating body and generally considered as one creature. It is rare to find human conjoined twins as 75 percent are born dead or die within 24 hours and even more uncertain are the fates of other species suffering from a similar condition.
