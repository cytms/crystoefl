And that even the Earth can look like a sickle previously patented by the Moon? If you happen to be there, that is, or even better, orbiting around it. Luckily, astronauts have been taking pictures of the Earth's crescent from Space for a while. Here’s a breathtaking selection.\nHere's the first ever picture of the Earth rising above the lunar surface, in black and white, taken by NASA’s Lunar Orbiter in August 1966.\n\nImage: \nThanks to modern digital technology, NASA has recently refurbished their collection of pictures, making history look even better. Here's the same image with a different slant.\n\nImage: \nEarth phases witnessed from the Moon are similar to the lunar phases we see on Earth. Because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth, one side of the Moon always faces the Earth. Therefore it takes as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around the Earth. The Moon completes one orbit around the Earth in a bit over 27 days, so Earthrises are very slow.\nThe Moon’s libration makes it possible to see more than 50% of the Moon’s surface over time from Earth or more than 50% of Earth’s surface from the outer edge of the Moon. Libration manifests itself as a slow rocking motion that can be back and forth or up and down.\nThe Apollo 11 mission was the first manned mission to land on the Moon. Upon setting foot on the Moon, mission commander Neil Armstrong spoke the famous words: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nBecause Earth and Moon are tidally locked, an Earthrise can not be seen by a stationary observer on the Moon’s surface but is best viewed from someone in orbit around the Moon.\n\nImage: \nThe next picture of the crescent Earth rising above the lunar horizon was taken during Apollo 17’s final lunar landing mission.\n\nImage: \nThe Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-8) recorded the next image close to midnight on June 22, 1996:\n\nImage: \nThe next image is truly amazing, especially given its history: It was captured more by accident on an Earth flyby of the comet-bound Rosetta spacecraft on Nov. 13, 2007. The picture is a composite of four images showing the crescent of the Earth at the bottom and the lit-up cities of the northern hemisphere on top: Europe is on the left, followed by the Middle East, India in the middle with the North Pole slightly off center and China, Korea and Japan on the right.\n\nImage: \nThe next image shows the Blue Planet in all its glory and most moon-sickle like. One can clearly see the Earth’s cloud systems, wind directions and the oceans.\n\nImage via \nA dramatic rendition of Earth rising behind the Moon and in front of the Sun, for the UK Planetary Forum.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nHere’s a video showing Earthrises then and now and even a spectacular Earthset:\n\n\nBeautiful, but it makes you feel somewhat small and insignificant as well.\n","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/flickr-237481352-hd.jpg","title":"Crescent-Shaped Earth Rising, As Seen From The Moon","author":"Simone Preuss"}
