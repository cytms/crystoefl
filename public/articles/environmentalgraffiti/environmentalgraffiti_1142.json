The idea suggests that Olympic souvenirs could be made from the material.\nApparently, state media said on Tuesday that researchers at the centre in Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan province, had created, bookmarks, photo frames, fans and panda statues out of the 300 tonnes of faeces produced by roughly 60 giant pandas each year.\nJing Shimin, assistant to the director of the base, proudly declared that the souvenirs would be relatively odour-free.\n\"They don't smell too bad because 70 percent of the dung is just remains of the bamboo that the pandas are unable to digest,\" he told Xinhua news agency.\n\"We used to spend at least 6,000 yuan ($770) a month to get rid of the droppings, but now they can prove lucrative as half of them will be sold as souvenirs.\"\nNot wishing to miss out on Olympic-inspired profits, the base is currently working on moulding the poop into statues of athletic pandas performing various Olympic sports to sell as 2008 Olympic Games souvenirs.\nA Thai zoo already sells multicoloured paper made from the excrement of its two resident pandas.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/27976448067f40035d30zjpg_0","title":"Wanna be Stinking Rich?
