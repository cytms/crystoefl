We’re not entirely sure whether it also senses furniture and errant pets but if it does then it’s pretty impressive.\nThe Play Coalition’s better known creation is 'Martyr', a monkey-shaped energy-saving lightbulb. The 'energy saving fundamentalist', as its creators have labelled it, is a simple visual reminder that we should be pulling all appliances out of their sockets when not in use – an environmental statement for your home as well as a conversation piece.\nUnfortunately you won't be able to find either of these creations in stores or online any time soon, however, if you absolutely love these and want to pressure their creators into making them available to the rest of us, head on over to \n to see these and some of their other environmentally-savvy designs.\nSource: \n, \n\n","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-i42.tinypic.com-2gua107.jpg","title":"The Plant Pot that Walks Into the Sunlight","author":"katherineliew"}
