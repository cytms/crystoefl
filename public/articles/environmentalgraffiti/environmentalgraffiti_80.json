There are eight different species of pelican but all are characterized by their large pouched bills.\n\"You ain't seen nothing yet!\" the pelican might be saying in this next image. Contrary to what some may imagine, pelicans don't store fish in their throat pouches. Instead, they use the pouches to catch the fish, draining the water out and then eating their prey immediately.\n\"Help! I'm lost!\" Somehow the pelican manages to stretch its pouch right around its face. Pelicans can carry an enormous amount of water in their pouches; the American White pelican, for example, can hold some three gallons.\nLoathe to stop the show, the pelican finishes off in style with a one-legged balancing act!\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/bigstockPeek-boo128179jpg_0","title":"The Entertaining Pelican and Its Wonderful Pouch","author":"Michele Collet"}
