The bar is supposedly powered by renewable energy and will serve organic spirits in polycarbon cups. It also has plans to install a power-generating dance floor and a recycling water system to flush the lavatories.\n\n\nEco-clubbers that want to have a good time will be allowed in for Â£10 and those that can prove they either walked, pedaled a bicycle or used public transport get in for free. Awesome! I suppose I'll have my bicycle seat with me or maybe the safety chain, in case they need evidence (or if they want a piece of me!)\nBased at Bar Surya in Pentonville Road, the club is owned by property millionaire and head of new climate change organization Club4Climate, Andrew Charalambous. The Greek-Cypriot businessman is trying to reach out to young people in an effort to save the world:\n\n\nI really like the idea, but there is one thing that some may not agree with. Apparently everyone needs to sign a pledge promising to work towards curbing climate change. Is it just me or does that sound annoying? Should I be not allowed to have fun, if I don't sign a piece of paper?\nWe'll still give it a try when the new eco-bar opens and probably tell you everything about it!\nSources \n, \n, ","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/tv.jpg","title":"Eco-Nightclub Launches: Dancers Generate Electricity","author":"mentol"}
