That's just shy of 130 pounds per person!\nFortunately, mature beef cattle can weigh over ten times that amount, so Uruguay is in no danger of being overrun, but is nevertheless a phenomenal exporter of beef, and apparently, not bad behind the grill either.","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Dreaming-manjpg_0","title":"World Record: Uruguayan Army Grills 12 Tons of Beef","author":"whatsrequired"}
