But modern medicine is recognizing the healing properties of German Chamomile in some not so common ways.\nOral mucositis is often a side effect of receiving chemotherapy to the head or neck. Inflamation and ulceration inside the mouth occur causing significant pain and discomfort. But because of the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties in German Chamomile it has been successful in alleviating the pain and discomfort when it is made into a tea and used as a mouthwash.\nGerman Chamomile is easy to grow. It can be grown nearly anywhere in the United States. Sprinkle the seeds from two dried flowers over loose soil and cover with a thin layer of dirt. Then water lightly. Seeds take about a week to germinate and then small sprouts begin to appear that look a great deal like carrot tops at the beginning.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Jewelweed.jpg","title":"The Healing Properties of German Chamomile","author":"Michele L Langlo"}
