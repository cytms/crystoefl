Unfortunately, the poll, released today, goes on to show that most British people are just too lazy to do anything about it.\nOnly 39% say they have bought energy efficient household appliance, whilst fewer, 37% have considered improving their insulation.  8% use an environmentally friendly energy provider.\nThis ambivalence towards environmentalism extends into the explicitly political.  A separate survey has shown that only 29% of UK adults would support green taxes were they introduced.  \nIt is worrying that whilst most people seem to recognise the importance of preserving the environment and of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, far fewer are willing to recognise that the solutions to these problems do involve personal sacrifice.\n ","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Cream17","title":"Lazy Brits Care About Environment But Do Nothing","author":"tom lyttelton"}
