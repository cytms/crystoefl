In some places, they are the security guards along with police and swat teams. The monkeys have become welcomed members because they stop other monkeys from running amok. \nCommon monkeys are often curious and love to come and scavenge in towns but the langur is very aggressive toward them and some langurs have been trained to keep other monkeys out to take advantage of this fact. During the Commonwealth Games, for example, 38 langurs were put into place among venues across New Delhi.\n.\nA New Delhi Municipal Council spokesman said about this astonishing development: \"We have deployed 38 langurs and it is a very effective way to scare away the common monkeys. We take these langurs on rent. Their trainers accompany them and once the assignment is over, they return home.\" \nLangurs are a problem in some areas of India but apart from being sentries or security guards, they also are considered holy in the Hindu religion. Hindus see them as a symbol of the deity Hanuman where legend has it that his monkey army rescued Sita from the demon king Ravana. Hanuman himself suffered burns in the attempt and the monkeys' black face and hands are considered manifestations of that. They live a life of luxury in Mondor and other regions.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/tyjryjdfghjg.jpg","title":"Langur Monkeys: India's Animal Sentries ","author":"Michele Collet"}
