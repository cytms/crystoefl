Currently, around 4 billion plastic bags go to landfills each year in London, and around 10 billion are used by British shoppers every year. \nOne option the councils are considering is having a tax of 10p to 15p per bag, although the Treasury department will likely veto such a move. A more likely option is that shoppers will have to buy reusable bags at the store or bring their own reusable bags with them.\nThe idea has already been put into practice in several other towns successfully.  A recent poll showed that 60% of Londoners were in favour of such a move.  \nSource: ","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/tv.jpg","title":"London Considering Plastic Bag Ban","author":"Chris"}
