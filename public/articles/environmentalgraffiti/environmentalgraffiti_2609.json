The U.S. base is host to only 125 scientists over the winter, which has been the real issue here. Winter brings the region into total darkness and many of the researchers simply leave - it is a time when everybody knows everyone else and passes large amounts of time indoors. Purchasing condoms therefore, has become a somewhat uncomfortable business.\nThe McMurdo station manager said that people get bored especially in this period, but they know how to occupy their time.  \nAfter the winter and up until the sun rises in full on August 20\n, the base is to be repopulated and the number of researchers will grow to about 1,100.","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/3582454365db451739b7jpg","title":"16,500 Condoms Delivered to Antarctica Research Base ","author":"Vlad Jecan"}
