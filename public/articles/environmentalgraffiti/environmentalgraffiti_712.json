Maybe more straightforward but certainly less magical. That's why we’re going to take a near microscopic tour of leaves, that's right, ordinary green, yellow, red, orange and even purple leaves. We were wondering what they must look like to those crawling on them and, after putting ourselves in the insects' shoes, made a stunning discovery: they live like us! They have networks of highways, streets, rivers and some very orderly settlements. The leaves seem to document these and work as their maps! Very interesting indeed...     \n\nImage: \n\nImage via \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nLeaf veins are the intricate and fascinating structural skeletons of leaves. They are also essential systems of nutrient and water transportation. Each vein consists of water-conducting tissue called \nand sap-conducting tissue called \n. They are surrounded by a protective wrapper of structural tissues. The space between the veins – a tissue called \n – is packed with chloroplasts, the organelles responsible for photosynthesis.   \nThe arrangement of the veins on a leaf is called venation. Here's a good example of a leaf with pinnate venation, meaning one mid-vein with smaller ones branching off laterally.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage via \n\nImage: \nResearchers have been fascinated by the patterns that leaf veins form and discovered that only one simple mechanical model may be at work in all leaves. Comparing leaf vein networks with webs of ropes and threads, in the model below, the spot where a small vein joins a large one is marked with a green arrow. The angles between the smaller and larger vein approach 90 degrees, like the angles would be when pulling on a light thread tied to a taut rope. Tree-way junctions of veins of the same size are marked with a red arrow and the angles between them have been found to be roughly 120 degrees.  \n\nImage via \n\nImage: \nThere are two subtypes of venation distinguished by the extension of the veins. \nvenation describes those leaves where the major veins stretch up to the margin. In \nleaves, major veins extend close to the margin but bend before they intersect with it. Below is an example of a craspedodromous leaf.\n\nImage: \nHere's an example of a camptodromous leaf.\n\nImage: \nJust as with human cities, insect settlements have their preferred areas.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nIn leaves, the main thoroughfares are called veins and in cities traffic arteries – something to ponder. \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nWintery landscapes have also been captured.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nWho said there are no alien insect life forms out there? \n\nImage: Cod Gabriel\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb24.webshots.com-44375-2296804540104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Leaves That Look Like Abstract Maps","author":"Simone Preuss"}
