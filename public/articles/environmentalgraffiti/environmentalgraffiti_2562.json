He’s addicted,” answered Mohammad when questioned on his actions as to why he introduced smoking to his 18-months-old boy. \nOne fascinating yet sad thing about this is that the child only smokes one brand and the family spends US $5.00 a day for his bad habit. \nThe child definitely can’t be blamed for his addiction and the actions of his parents. Many blame two reasons for the boy's addiction: the father introducing smoking to his child and the mother taking no action to stop or prevent that from happening.  \nOfficials even tried to bribe the family with a car if they made the boy quit but his father disagreed: “He looks pretty healthy to me. I don’t see any problem.”\nRelated articles: ","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/temple10.jpg","title":"Indonesia's 2 Year-Old Chain Smoking Baby","author":"JannMartin"}
