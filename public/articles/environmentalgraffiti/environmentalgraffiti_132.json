Later in the season, its leaves appear in the shape of hearts, but with a fuzzy underside.\nWhether any of the following nicknames help to describe this plant may depend on each person's imagination, but the list includes bog rhubarb, bogshorns, langwort and umbrella leaves. There are also several riffs on the word \"dock\": blatterdock, butter-dock, butterly dock, capdockin and flapperdock.\nBeyond the visual description, Butterbur has a distinctive and rather unpleasant aroma.\nButterbur grows in marshlands or near rivers or damp ditches in northern Asia, Europe and North America. Some of the aforementioned nicknames, like \"bog rhubarb\", already indicate their preference for wet ground.\nSince Butterbur is native to Asia, it is labelled an invasive species. However, it is considered a serious problem, possibly because few people care deeply about the exact mix of plants in bogs and marshes. \nButterbur has a long history in folk medicine and herblore. It has been used externally to cover ulcerated or wounded skin. Various Butterbur preparations have been taken internally for ailments such as asthma and whooping cough; the modern prescriptive phrase would be \"anti-spasmodic\".\nModern studies have been conducted to investigate whether Butterbur could treat other problems, such as migraine headaches and allergic rhinitis. Despite some early hopes based on folk medicine, Butterbur seems unlikely to help heal skin problems such as eczema.\nVarious studies have shown that Butterbur does contain harmful \"pyrrolizidine alkaloid\" compounds. Anyone considering using a Butterbur-based herbal medication should ensure the product is \"PA free\": meaning the \"pyrrolizidine alkaloids\" have been removed.\nButterbur does well in plant hardiness zones ranging from 5 through 9. It is an herbaceous perennial. Plants should be well-spaced, about 1.8m (5 feet) apart. Plant sections of the rhizomes to start them growing.\nRemember that Butterbur is an invasive plant; it may outcompete others inside its preferred environment.\nHerbalists, nature-lovers and students of botany have many reasons to appreciate Butterbur, a versatile plant with many names.\n: \n.\n \n \n:\nEBSCO and NYU Lanone Medical Center, \"\n\", 2011, referenced June 29, 2011. \nMonica Rhodes, Health Wise, \"\n\", updated: June 30, 2009, referenced June 29, 2011. \nSteven D.
