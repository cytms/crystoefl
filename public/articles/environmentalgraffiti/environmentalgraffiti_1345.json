In fact, India Shining was the political slogan with which India started the first decade of the new millennium. Without doubt, it has always been a country of colours so, inspired by last week’s article on rainbows, we’ve arranged stunning pictures of Indian moodscapes according to the rainbow spectrum. Put on some A.R. Rahman, Cat Stevens/Yusuf Islam or even Lucky Ali and follow us on an Indian tour de rang…\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nOne of Mumbai’s most recognizable landmarks is the Haji Ali mosque and tomb between Worli and the southern part of town. Built in 1431, the days of this mosque may be numbered as its structure has been eroded beyond repair by the force of Arabian Sea over the centuries. Plans exist to tear it down and rebuild it with the same marble that has served the Taj Mahal in Agra so well. Currently, up to 40,000 people of all faiths visit the mosque on Thursdays and Fridays. According to legend, Haji Ali, a wealthy merchant, drowned at this spot while on a pilgrimage to Mecca. In any case, it is a place of inspiration for many that has hardly been captured as beautifully as in the following picture. \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nPainted green – pigeons, those universal creatures, gather near the Taj Mahal hotel in South Mumbai:\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nThe next picture is not taken at a temple but at a private house in Cochin. The person sitting on the right is therefore not a statue but the photographer’s brother meditating. \n\nImage: \nThe Gateway of India is another one of Mumbai’s recognizable sites and one with historical significance too. Construction of the 26m-high (85 ft) basalt arch started in 1911 and was completed in 1924. Built on reclaimed land at the southern tip of the island that is Mumbai, it used to be the first sight that hopeful visitors arriving by boat would spot.  \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nMix all colours and you will get grey, even in a colourful melting pot like Mumbai... \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nThe Qutb Minar (“axis minaret”) in New Delhi is the world’s tallest free-standing brick minaret at 72 m (238 ft). Built between 1193 and 1386, Qutb Minar is one of the earliest examples of Indo-Islamic architecture. The whole Qutb complex is a UNESCO world heritage site.  \n\nImage: \nIndia Shining, a slogan popularised by the then ruling Baratya Janata Party (BJP) for the 2004 general elections in India, referred to an overall feeling of economic optimism after a good monsoon in 2003 and the Indian IT boom in 2004. Satirised as India Shining – Bharat Drowning (Bharat being the Hindi name for India), we hope that in view of the nearing monsoon and the ongoing elections, this will not be the case…   \nSource: \n, \n, ","web_category":"travel","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb46.webshots.com-43501-2637862130104178106S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"The Rainbow Coloured Skies of India","author":"Simone Preuss"}
