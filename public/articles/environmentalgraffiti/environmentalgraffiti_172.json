{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-fly-geyser","content":"\nThis magnificent geyser is partially man-made. One of nature's wonders helped along by human hand, it is actually not truly a geyser because it originally came about due to a well hole. In 1916, a well was drilled where it stands and produced water for years, until 1960 when heated water from an underground geothermal source broke through a weak spot in the well wall.\n \nAlong with the geothermal water came minerals, including sulphur dioxide, which gives the geyser its incredible coloring. What's more, the minerals don't just color the geyser but have caused the build-up of its shapes, including the overall look of a fly over 5 feet high. There are dozens of terraces that the water flows into and hectares of land that are affected.\nLocated in the Hualapai Flat in Nevada, the geyser is on private property, but luckily for tourists who want to see it, it's visible from the main road. The ponds caused by the geyser are also home to a rich bird life.\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb41.webshots.com-45672-2936915180105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Fly Geyser: Nevada's Hidden Geothermal Treasure","author":"Michele Collet"}
