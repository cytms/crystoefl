The trees removed 91% of the toxic trichloroethylene compound from a liquid solution in the lab where they were grown. Trichlorethylene is the most common ground water contaminant in the US.\nA team from the University of York led by researchers Rosamond Jackson and Neil Bruce has also created a soil and water cleansing plant. The group has created a batch of modified Arabidopsis plants that reduced the level of potentially cancerous explosive RDX in water and soil by up to 97%.\nAlthough these are potentially massive advances in soil cleanup science, there are of course worries about GM plants being introduced into the natural ecosystem. \nThe Washington team has already responded to fears of widespread GM forests. They specifically chose the poplar tree for its ability to grow for years without producing flowers, so that they may be removed before they develop seeds and spread.\nBoth teams point out that the plants can only be grown for research purposes, per US and UK law. The UW team hopes to experiment further at monitored government cleanup sites.  \n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/2443767203_dafdf1a4f8_b.jpg","title":"Miracle GM Plants Stuffed With Rabbit Genes Mutate Into Toxic Vacuum Cleaner ","author":"Chris"}
