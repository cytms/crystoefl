But far from being sheepish, these bovids like to have it their way, literally. As the following pictures show, roads, rivers and even steep, narrow bridges cannot deter a herd of sheep. And those surrounded and stuck better show some patience.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nHave you ever wondered if a group of sheep is called a herd or a flock? Well, it’s both actually. And those a little more adventurous can even say a mob of sheep.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nAs respected members of the traffic community, sheep even have their own street signs. \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage via \n\nImage: \nHere’s an interesting statistic: There are about one billion(!) domestic sheep in the world. No wonder really, if one considers that the sheep was one of the earliest animals domesticated for agricultural purposes. \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nOf those one billion sheep, about 158 million live in China (that’s about one tenth of a sheep per inhabitant), just a bit over 100 million in Australia (five sheep per inhabitant), 63 million in India (about one twentieth of a sheep per inhabitant; maybe one lamb shank?), 54 million in Iran, 48 million in Sudan (pretty much exactly one sheep per inhabitant), 39 million in New Zealand (a record 9 sheep per inhabitant), 36 million in the UK and 25 million in South Africa (according to UN FAO 2004 figures). Wow, that’s a whole lot of sheep!          \n\nImage via \n\nImage: \n\nImage: Unknown photographer via \nFor those who started counting sheep – stop yawning and watch the following video of a family stuck in sheep traffic in Ioannina, Greece.\n\n\nSource: \n, ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/teaserEtnaeruptionseenfromtheInternationalSpaceStationjpg","title":"Warning: Sheep Crossing!","author":"Simone Preuss"}
