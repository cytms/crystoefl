Resomation Ltd, a Glasgow-based company, wants to change that.\n \n \n\nhas patented a new method of disposing of human remains which they claim is environmentally friendly.  The process, named resomation from the Greek word resoma, meaning rebirth, involves incasing bodies in a silk coffin and submerging them in water and potassium hydroxide.  When heated to 170 degrees centigrade the body “returns to its constituent parts”, forming a white dust that Resomation Ltd refers to as bio-ash, and which can be given to relatives in an urn as with cremation.\n\nResomation requires lower temperatures and less energy than cremation, and neutralises embalming chemicals in the process.  Whereas cremation releases harmful fumes such as mercury, Resomation Ltd are billing their process as simply a speeded up form of natural decomposition. Costs are similar to those involved in cremation, and about a thousand bodies in the United States have already been processed with resomation.\nBurial space in the UK is already at a premium and authorities have said they will consider any proposals for alternatives to traditional burials.\n ","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/tongue_0.jpg","title":"Environmental Burials: a Step Too Far?","author":"Maryking"}
