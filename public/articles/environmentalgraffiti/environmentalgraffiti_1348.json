Welcome to Antarctica, the place where you’ll find big eyes and bolos, new species of the human kind. Inspired by Anton Chekalin’s stunning pictures of \n featured last month, we got thinking about everyday life at a Russian Antarctic station. \nWhen planning a stay in the Antarctic, getting there might be the first hurdle, but not the last. In psychospeak, ICE stands for isolated, confined environment and is very fitting when talking about Antarctic living conditions. There’s also everyday life on a base to reckon with, getting around and surviving out in the field, and killing time when nothing is going on…    \n\nNovolazarevskaya has its own airstrip but landing is a challenge for any pilot as the runway is made of pure ice, and there is no snow on top to minimize skidding. One wrong move can have dire consequences. Still, a difficult runway is better than none, and Novolazarevskaya is an important hub from where other Antarctic stations receive their supplies. \n\nImage: \nIn olden times, the only way to the Arctic or Antarctic was through the ice, so the invention of the first ice breaker was a big event. Here’s more about it from a New York Times article on April 12th, 1899, titled “Russia’s Ice Breaker: Trial of the Vessel Designed to Facilitate Commerce in Frozen Harbors”, about the maiden voyage of the Ermak from Newcastle to Cronstadt:\n\nImage via \n\nImage via \n\nAlready in 1959, the Soviet Union had built the Antarctic research station Lazarev, named after admiral Michael Lazarev, close to Schirmacher Oasis in Queen Maud Land in Eastern Antarctica. Though the continent’s smallest oasis, its proximity to the coast and a 100 m-high plateau shielding it from inland ice flowing north contribute to the milder climate than in surrounding areas. Perfect then as protection from the harsh winds and snowbanks, which is why in 1961, the research station was moved directly into the oasis and renamed Novolazarevskaya (New-Lazarev). \n\nImage: \nVostok research station is at the center of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, about 1,300 km from the Geographic South Pole. It is also the place where the lowest reliably measured temperature ever was recorded on July 21, 1983: ?89.2 °C (?128.6 °F). Brrr! \nLocated 3,488 meters above sea level and near a point called the Southern Pole of Inaccessibility, it is the most isolated established research station on the Antarctic continent. No wonder then that the usual capacity of 25 people drops to 13 in the winter. \n\nImage via \n\nImage via \nBut life on an Antarctic base is not all drab: payphones are provided for long-distance calls, if one has enough change!\n\nImage via \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nNobody can or would want to stay at the base camp the whole time, so transport vehicles are crucial in these extreme conditions.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nSupplies are crucial for Antarctic survival but with quite a few stations close to each other, even in times of emergency the bare necessities can be procured. Water might be a bigger problem, even in a country where so much ice is available. During extreme winter temperatures and snow storms, any trip outside becomes a challenge. \n\nImage: \nThen, of course, there are the Antarctic storms where making it depends on the survival kit one carries: tent, food, stove, signal mirror, extra cold-weather clothing and some entertainment in the form of a book, crossword or a game in case the storm lasts a couple of days…. \n\nImage via \nAnd speaking of survival, there’s the question of killing time. But given that Antarctica is a desert with a lot of ice around, that problem is quickly solved as drinking becomes a favorite pastime.   \n\nImage via \nSays Nicholas Johnson, author of the book \n, about the phenomenon: \nThe choice of entertainment can be fairly eclectic: \nSurely that’s not the image the Soviet government had in mind when sending researchers on Arctic and Antarctic missions. “The Great Stalin Plan for the Transformation of Nature” of the late 1940s was devised to bring water to the semi-arid Soviet hinterland. The plan called for channeling fresh water from the Russian Arctic all the way to the USSR’s central plains – ambitious ecological manipulation efforts that thankfully never saw fruition. \n\nImage via \n\nSpeaking of linguistic manipulation, any close-knit group will devise terminology of its own; so too Antarctic explorers and support staff. So for those still wondering about the bolos and the big eyes, here’s a glossary of popular Antarctic slang:\nFor more terminology, check out this excellent \n.\nSource: \n, \n, \n, \n\n","web_category":"travel","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/15_lighthouse_0.jpg","title":"Everyday Life At The Russian Antarctic Station","author":"Simone Preuss"}
