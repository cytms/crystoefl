Here are my first 3 must reads for this week:\n1) \n - Gotta love Ooffoo's winning Laureate article for 2010. And I used to work there so I know the team and they are lovely!\n2) \n - who doesn't Treehugger? Well, I love 'em and always find something worth reading there.\n3) \n - I work for this magazine and we recently published a green issue. This was my #1 pick and the most read article online. A real winner.","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/7-foods_veggies.jpg","title":"My green picks of the week","author":"Al_Tepper"}
