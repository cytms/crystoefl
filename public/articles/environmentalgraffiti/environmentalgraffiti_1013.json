The draft recommends close-range shotgun blasts, whacks in the head with a metal pipe, and “forcefully swinging” young kangaroo heads against vehicle tow bars.  The methods are meant to be used if a young animal is orphaned due to a vehicle accident or \n.\nWhile the methods may seem a bit cruel, they’re certainly more humane than the alternative. Orphaned joeys usually starve. While many people would want to save the \n, possibly by sending them to a wildlife center, the Department of Environment discourages that idea due to the fact that there are already far too many of the animals.  In particularly \n hit areas \n are at plague levels and they’re a pest in many other areas of the country. The army has recently had to institute a euthanasia program for the kangaroos on its bases in Canberra to prevent mass starvation of the animals.\nA Department of Environment spokesperson said: \"I think we all love kangaroos. The problem is that there are too many. What we are talking about here is responsible environmental management, because if we don't do something you won't have pastures and viable farming. We are trying to come up with something that is practicable to use across sometimes remote parts of the country.\"\nHowever, at least one former lawmaker believes these practices could \n in the wake of the Australian government’s actions against \n.  Conservationist and former politician Richard Jones said: \"We can hardly take the high moral ground on animal welfare and whale conservation when the government is prepared to condone barbaric practices regarding our native wildlife.\"\nDespite Jones’ reservations most Australian animal groups are generally in favor of the government’s humane killing plan, although the \n and the Wildlife Protection Association, founded by \n, asked the government to drop shotgun use from the drafted proposal. The Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia defended the current recommended methods of joey euthanasia, including using metal pipes and striking the animals against tow bars.  Their executive officer John Kelly said: \"Animal welfare is precisely what this code of practice is all about.”\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb10.webshots.com-10249-2293199970104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Australian Government Recommends Hitting Baby Kangaroos With Metal Pipes","author":"Chris"}
