Ever.\nThe image was taken by three University of Toronto scientists using the Gemini North telescope trained on the distant star (lovingly named '1RXS J160929.1-210524'). Up until this point, the only planet-like objects scientists had clearly observed in space did not appear locked in orbit around a star much like our own sun. This could shake up some widely held astronomical theories though, since the supposed planet is located farther from it's 'sun' than researchers thought possible. That is, if continued observation can confirm that this large mass actually is orbiting the star.
