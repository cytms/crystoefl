The science isn't too hard to remember once you know it. Basically, solar wind is responsible for exciting atoms in the atmosphere. When the atoms are returning to their normal state (losing energy), they give off light. The reason this only happens in the poles is due to the way the Earth's magnetic field affects the solar wind. The auroras usually occur at an altitude of 90-300km.\n - The aurora is caused by oxygen and hydrogen.\n - The aurora is caused by nitrogen. \nEnough talk - on with the rest of the pics!\nThis picture was taken in 1992. NASA and NASDA staff had a prime location to view the Aurora, which are usually only partially viewed on Earth.\nAn aurora photo which captures the vivid green beautifully.\nThis picture was taken by Nick Russill in September 2005 in Kulusuk, Greenland.
