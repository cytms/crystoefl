The project is now, however, several years behind schedule and billions of pounds over budget. The US Government Accountability Office is now estimating the cost of the project to be close to £10 billion.\nThe original plan said for the US government and the state of Florida to split costs equally. While Florida has set aside £1 billion for the plan, the federal government has diverted its share of the money to reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina and the amount the Iraq war has ended up costing.\nThe everglades are currently half the size they were 150 years ago. Construction booms as well as dykes and dams have shrunk the swamplands from their original 4 million acres.\nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/2748c89b8f085c23405366b3eb808d56_0.jpg","title":"Everglades Restoration Project Grinds to Halt","author":"Chris"}
