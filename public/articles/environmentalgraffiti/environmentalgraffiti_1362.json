One cave named “Trinidad Grund” contains cave paintings that may date back 25.000 years.\nNevertheless, it is most known for its hair rasing walkway constructed in the early 1920’s, known as El Camino del Rey This path is flanked on the right side by a huge gorge and the other has no handrail offering no protection from falling kilometers down. To make matters worse, it hasn’t been maintained for several decades - some parts of the walkway have fallen increasing its potential fatality.\nAs you can imagine, many travelers and adventurers have walked the path, but local authorities were forced to close the King’s walkway to the public after a number of tourists lost their lives in the venture.\nThe Spanish officials say they will provide the necessary funding for the restoration of the King’s walkway. After maintenance is completed, the path may be reopened to tourists, but you have the chance to take a few nervous steps on it, I leave you with this breathtaking video:\n\n","web_category":"travel","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/5bigstockSnowPalace4205587jpg","title":"Walking Along the Scariest Path in The World","author":"Vlad Jecan"}
