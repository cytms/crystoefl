A Minotaur rocket had launched just about an hour before the photo was taken, leaving behind a very photogenic plume of smoke. The contrail shows amazing rainbow-colored flashes picked up from the setting sun, even though it was captured at night. This usually happens when clouds are high in the upper atmosphere; they reflect sunlight while the lower clouds appear dark, resulting in a lustrous iridescent sky.\nThere are hundreds of similar images available on NASAâ€™s \n, too, like this one taken on September 28, 2005, near the same air base. In it, the planet Venus is clearly visible.\nSource \n, ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb64.webshots.com-27263-2817095160105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Iridescent Sky","author":"Linda"}
