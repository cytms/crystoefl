Hua Mei, also born at the San Diego Zoo, has given birth to three cubs in the Wolong reserve after she returned to the country.  The animals are critically endangered with only about 1,600 of the creatures surviving in the wild. Only about 180 pandas live in captivity.\nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/cyclops_gallery__320x400_0.jpg","title":"Next Week's Headline: \"Giant Panda Killed By Air Pollution\"","author":"Chris"}
