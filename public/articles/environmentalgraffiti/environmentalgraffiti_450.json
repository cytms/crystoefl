Titles include 'Pangolins, Unicorns and Other Poems' (Marianne Moore), 'What on Earth Is A... Pangolin' (Edward R. Ricciuti) and 'Roly Poly Pangolin' (Anna Dewdney).\n Male Indian Pangolins can be up to 90% heavier than their female counterparts.\nDue to the lack of scales on their snout, eyes, ears and underbelly, pangolins curl into a ball for protection when threatened. They can also use the glands on their anus to produce a foul smelling acid in order to deter predators.\n Pangolins do not have teeth, nor can they chew, but feed by opening anthills/termite mounds with their claws and catch the insects with their sticky tongues, which can be up to 70cm long!\n Pangolins have prehensile tails that they can use for balance or hanging from tree branches.\n The main predators of pangolins are humans and big cats, such as lions, tigers and leopards.\n Although modern pangolins live only in Africa and Asia, pangolin fossils have also been found in Europe and North America.\nPangolins have very poor eyesight and so they rely on their keen sense of smell to navigate and find food.\n As they have very long claws on their front paws, which are unsuitable for walking, pangolins often walk on their hind legs.\n\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/1299612282927c9a83fczjpg","title":"15 Fascinating Facts You Didn't Know About Pangolins","author":"pumpkinstar"}
