It is a day of celebration, of remembering and honoring those who came before.\nIn Sumpango, Guatemala, a unique tradition has developed.  For months, groups work to build giant kites.  The kites frames are made of bamboo and the kites themselves are made of tissue paper. The designs are incredibly intricate and often hold a political message.\nOn November 1, All Saints Day, the giant kites are taken to a sacred hill on the outside of town, overlooking the main cemetery.  There is music, dancing, food and general celebration.  The kites are raised for all to admire.
