Welcome to the world of creative taxidermy, where wild creatures are turned into the weirdest forms of art you could ever imagine.\n\nOn the upside, most modern taxidermy artists use animals that have already died from natural causes and aren't killing the creatures for their skins, so at least the animals aren't victimized by their eventual transformations.\nWhile the idea of strange taxidermy art is still quite novel, it is nothing new. Taxidermists have been creating fantastical creatures from everyday animals for centuries. While some of the creations were made for the sake of art, many taxidermists worked to fool the general public into believing the bizarro monsters were real. The hoaxes were so common at one point that when a dead platypus was first introduced to Britain, many dignitaries and scientists were convinced it was mere \n.\nOne of the most common examples was the \n, but the animals came in all shapes and sizes and included furry fish, flying domestic animals and off-the-wall mash-ups like \n. Many fine examples of these vintage taxidermy works were recently auctioned off at \n after an English collector, Robert Ball, was forced to sell off the collection of artifacts he housed in his wax museum on the Isle of Wight.\nWhile many of the modern art taxidermists are creating utterly strange works that could never be construed as belonging to an actual animal, some of the most talented in their field are keeping things classic and making delightfully realistic combinations of everyday animals.  \n is one of the most talented artists in this vein, and her \n and \n are entirely realistic and an honorable tribute to classic taxidermy concoctions.\nHungarian artist \n likes to take \n in an entirely different direction, by creating distorted versions of everyday animals, like this cow-head that looks more like a beach ball.\n specializes in mechanizing standard taxidermy statues. This \n is probably her best known work and has been featured on a number of sites across the web – and with good reason: it looks like a Terminator model that’s come back for Bambi.\nFor those of you who like steampunk, you’re sure to dig on this guinea pig time machine being used by a tiny mouse with a sharp fashion sense. Perhaps the most impressive thing about this piece, titled Chuffy and The Time Machine, is just how detailed it is for its size. The \n has even more detailed pictures to blow your mind.\nThere are plenty of technology-inspired present day creations around as well. The \n is pretty much exactly what it sounds and looks like: a computer case mod that’s made from the body of a taxidermied beaver. If that’s not good enough for you, then consider rounding out your new desk set up by making your own computer mouse with a real mouse thanks to \n.\nIf you’re okay with running your hands all over a dead mouse to operate your computer, then you probably won’t have any problems with wearing these taxidermied fashion accessories made by artist \n. From bird-wing headbands to guinea pig hair combs, these \n are sure to get you noticed, but don’t be surprised if your reward is in the form of a bucket of red paint.\nWhat do you guys think about taxidermy art? It’s surely disturbing, but so was Picasso’s art and Salvador Dali’s work, and isn’t the true point of art to get people thinking? If so, then these creators have surely made their marks.","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/IA1jpg","title":"The World's Creepiest Taxidermy Art ","author":"whysteriastar"}
