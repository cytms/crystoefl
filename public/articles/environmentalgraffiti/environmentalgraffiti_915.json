With a desire to bring the number of wolves down to approximately 900, the state is preparing for litigation from an organization called \n, which believes that the wolves will not be secure in their environment until the population rests between 2 and 3,000.\nThis represents the latest in a twenty-year battle between advocates for the animals, who have even compiled a fund to compensate ranchers for losses inflicted upon livestock, and those who believe the wolves are a menace, who have previously rallied under the slogan \"No Wolves, No Way.\"   If the wolves were to fall below 800 in population again, the expectation is that the federal protections would resume, a cold comfort to supporters of the species.\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/wolf_1.jpg","title":"Gray Wolf Repopulation So Successful It's Time To Kill Them","author":"whatsrequired"}
