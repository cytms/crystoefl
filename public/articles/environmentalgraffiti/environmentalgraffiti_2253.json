Unfortunately for us, we may not even know what we're looking for.\n\n\nThe New Scientist says that life is so \n that we may never know if it's out there.\nCiting over 280 definitions of life--all of which miss the point somewhat-- Sohan Jeeta, an  astrobiologist, floated his own definition this week at an astrobiology conference:\n\n\nSchoolchildren all over the world are rejoicing over the possibility of this being on a test. But why does life need a definition?\nBecause without one, we won't know if what we find out in interstellar space is indeed life.  The vast differences in environment would obviously create a form that's almost entirely unrecognizable to us. Looking for amino acids, or any other essentials to life on earth, would leave us missing the point with something that's adapted to a completely different world.\nFirst defining life, and in the most open-ended manner possible, is the only way to design experiments and instrumentation to be able to look for aliens. Unless, of course, they show up and try to kill us. That's always an option, too.","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/stars_0.jpg","title":"We May Have Found Aliens, And Not Known It","author":"whatsrequired"}
