We’re going to forget animals for the most part and talk about another Kingdom that shaped the face of the Earth.\nKingdom Plantae, or the \n kingdom, will be the focus of our article today. While animals usually get more attention, plants have had an arguably greater impact on the world in which we live. The first plants are closely linked to some of the creatures we discussed in earlier articles, in particular cyanobacteria and green \n. They share a very important characteristic with these early species, namely \n.\nPlants evolved chloroplasts, the organelles that conduct \n in plants, from earlier \n relationships between cyanobacteria and small single celled organisms. All members of the plant kingdom display photosynthesis. For those of you who have forgotten your childhood science lessons, photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert carbon dioxide, water, and the sun’s energy into chemical energy for the plant and an \n.  They get glucose to power them, we get fresh air.\nThe earliest plants were tiny water based organisms. These were found during the Cambrian period, and were closely related to algae. Soon after the Cambrian period, however, \n started to creep up on to the land. Starting around 450 million years ago, the planet started going green.\n\n\nOne  of the major steps in \n, one that allowed them to spread on land effectively, was the widespread occurrence of spores as a form of plant reproduction. These spores often had hard shells, which has enabled us to find them in the \n quite easily. Due to the nature of the plants at the time, plant species were restricted to waterlogged environments. Because they did not have any tissue that conducted water very well, they had to stay close to it to obtain the water they needed for photosynthesis. These \n could travel until they reached a suitably wet environment in which to grow, helping the plants spread all over their chosen environment.\nMore complex plant forms began to occur during the time known as the \n. The \n period (circa 450 to 410 million years ago) also marked the first appearance of plants with vascular systems. These are essentially plant veins that carry around water, chemicals, minerals, et cetera within the plant. Shortly after this time period, we start seeing some familiar faces. The ferns made their appearance on the stage. During the late \n period, (385 to 359 million years ago) we started seeing plants that worked a lot like plants do today. We started getting larger plants, and we started seeing plants that had root systems and leaves for the first time.\n\n\n\nSome of the world’s most majestic and massive trees appeared after this. In the Permian period, conifers appeared and they thrived.  The conifers are cone bearing seed plants, mostly trees. The conifer family includes \n, cedars, cypress, and the massive \n, among others.\nConifers became the most dominant plant family in the world during the Mesozoic era. This was also the era of the dinosaurs. While T-Rex was \n, the conifer family spread until massive conifer forests covered most of the planet. The fern was also quite abundant during this period, as it grew well in the undergrowth of these forests.\nBy the end of the \n, we see some of the more popular plant species come to be. The \n, or flowering plants, came into existence.  By the end of the period, they were the predominant species, although not without a little help. The predominance of angiosperms is closely related to the evolution of certain insects, most notably the \n.  The fates of the two organisms were closely linked, and they coevolved for some time.\nAbout 35 million years ago, the first grasses began to evolve from these angiosperms, and we began to see landscape similar to today’s savannahs start to dominate the landscape. These grasses became very important to our own evolution. About 10,000 years ago, human beings figured out how to domesticate these grasses, resulting in the beginning of agriculture. From there, we begin to see the beginnings of civilization.\n\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/2443767203_dafdf1a4f8_b.jpg","title":"Mother Earth: Plants Rule the Land","author":"Chris"}
