Now, it's \"Go Barefoot Day.\"\nYes, in the proud tradition of Paul McCartney, who famously strolled loafer-less across Abbey Rd., HOK is asking their 2,500 employees to \n as a conscious reminder of other ways to cut back.  The internal flyer, which is \n, stresses cutting back in your methods of transit and work habits-- virtual meetings instead of cross-country flights, mass transit instead of a carpool, even using your own mug for that morning trip to Starbucks.\nIt is wonderful to see such a large organization pick up the fight, even if only for one day, and especially one in an industry that's so well-positioned to do some good as HOK.
