This isn't the first lake in Chile to potentially undergo the flood-drain-fill cycle, either; last year, Lake Tempano in Bernando Higgins  National Park disappeared with no explanation, but has since recovered.","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Andrew-7.jpg","title":"Water Bores 5-Mile Hole In Glacier, Unleashes Riverbound Tsunami","author":"whatsrequired"}
