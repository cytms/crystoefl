The single biggest challenge to the project so far?  finding the things after they land-- officials are skeptical about attaching a transmitter because of how they might damage the flight characteristics.\n","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/PIA15283jpg","title":"Japanese Build Paper Plane For Outer Space","author":"whatsrequired"}
