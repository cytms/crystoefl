Not reported in North America until appearing in Oswego, New York in 1896, probably from a ship's ballast, farmers realized what the beetles were doing to their crops in 1933, and have been trying and failing to hold them at bay ever since. Fortunately, for whatever reason, the beetle has chosen not to spead beyond an area in Upstate New York and the Canadian province of Ontario, limiting its effect.\nInfo From \n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb15.webshots.com-43726-2432768000104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Army of Worms Destroys Army of Beetles, New York Approves","author":"whatsrequired"}
