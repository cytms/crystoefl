Take the nudibranch, a shell-less mollusk, or sea slug. The nudibranch has evolved many colour and shape variations in order to camouflage itself or warn potential predators that it is poisonous or otherwise unpleasant to eat. Depending on the species, size also ranges from the very teeny tiny of 20 mm (3/4 of an inch) up to 600 mm (about two feet).\nAnd although nudibranchs can be found in reef habitats around the world, they can be difficult to locate, so we've gathered 20 exceptional photos for you to feast your eyes on. Take a look and we think you'll agree that the unassuming 'nudi' (as they are so fondly referred to in online forums) are without a doubt some of the most colourful and charming critters in the world. But the wonders of the nudi don't stop here; we encourage you to check out the websites of the photographers we've featured as they've got oodles of stunning nudibranch pictures for you to admire!\nWe'll end off the set with a few photos of nudibranchs hanging out together ... aren't they cute?\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb19.webshots.com-41234-2153467240104178106S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"20 Most Incredible Nudis","author":"soniaydong"}
