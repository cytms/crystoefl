If global temperatures rise by over 2? C by 2050, around 20% of the world’s population will face a high risk of drought.  Some places not affected by drought will likely experience floods, including China and Bangladesh.\n2,500 climate change scientists compiled the report.  The report is expected to have an effect on talks in Bali next month. Bali will host a UN conference on climate change, and a new agreement along the lines of the Kyoto Protocols is expected to be drawn up.\nThe scientists do offer some hope, saying it is possible to halt climate change if emissions are reduced by 2015. Unfortunately, current trends point to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe report says that a global temperature rise of up to 5 ?C could occur if no changes are made in emission levels. This could result in “significant extinctions.” \nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb06.webshots.com-40197-2096283280103691965S600x600Q85_0.jpg","title":"Another Day, Another UN Report Warning of Worldwide Extinctions","author":"Chris"}
