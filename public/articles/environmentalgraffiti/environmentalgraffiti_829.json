Hellraiser XXVI, The Root of All Evil: Sometimes turnips just go bad.\n\n\n\n2. Run for your lives! The killer cucumber is on the loose. Arrragh! *runs away shrieking like a girl.\n\n\n\n3. Talk about creepy looking babies. This one resembles something from a Harry Potter film.\n\n\n\n4. These dodgy looking vegetables featured in an advertising campaign for Progress Kids milk, claiming their milk has \"a third of your child's daily nutrition. Because vegetables are scary.\" Bet parents had a great time getting their kids to eat their greens after that!\n\n\n\n\n\n5. What’s cooler than Alien? Why, veggie Alien, of course. Aren’t these images awesome? OK, while they’re not exactly images of real veggies, they just had to be included for the creep factor. They were created by artist Till Nowak and inspired by the works of HR Giger and Giuseppe Arcimboldo.\n\n\n\nVeggie alien in detail. We think it could do with some acidic drool to make it more realistic.\n\n\n\n6. Alien offspring of a ravished parsnip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. The ackee fruit, when ripe and opened, looks a bit too much like giant spider's eyes for our liking. It's hard to know whether to eat it or hide from it.\n\n\n\n8. Children of the Corn strikes again.\n\n\n\n9. Alien carrot spawn.\n\n\n\n10. That's one alien looking spud.\n\n\n\n11. If you're not careful, that little blighter in the middle will bite your nose off if you get too close. It looks as if it's ready to attack at any moment.\n\n\n\n12. This creepy heart-shaped potato looks as if it's been possessed by the bark monster.\n\n\n\n\n1. One more click and the pumpkin gets it.\n\n\n\n2. OK, OK, don't explode on us, we'll do whatever you want!\n\n\n\n3. The creepy brood of a half-ton pumpkin.\n\n\n\n4. Certainly wouldn't like to meet this pumpkin on the street corner. It looks ready to bite the legs off anyone who'd get close enough.\n\n\n\n5. Scared enough, yet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Inspired by cartoons, pumpkin carver Karen Quinn, comes up with great new designs every year, like this scary one.\n\n\n\n7. Noel, from Fantasty Pumpkins, has got pumpkin carving down to a fine art. The idea for this pumpkin head was taken from the movie \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Doing the 'Haka'.\n\n\n\n9. One for all the \n fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. No one will mess with this veggie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Stick 'em up, spuddy.\n\n\n\n2. The busy-body aubergine. He gets pestered by all the scary veggies.\n\n3. We're not sure whether these carrots look shifty, or rude.\n\n\n\n4. This scorpion carrot was featured as part of a Greenpeace campaign to raise awareness of GM foods. The text, which is missing in this image, says: \"The DNA of genetically modified plants may contain the genes of insects, animals or even viruses.\" Hence the scorpion, and why it's as scary as hell!\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The photographer thinks this carrot looks like a bull. We need to get our minds out of the gutter.\n\n\n\n6. Talking about gutters: What happens when you cross a lady yam...\n\n\n\n7. ... with an excited potato?\n\n\n\n8. You get one strange looking family.\n\n\n\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb43.webshots.com-42410-2825839170104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"30 Creepiest Vegetables on Earth","author":"Linda"}
