But then again, don't we all hide our most sensitive qualities under a prickly exterior sometimes?\nMany cactus flowers are night blooming as they get pollinated by nocturnal insects like moths or small animals like bats. Depending on the cactus species, the flower shapes can be tube-like, bell-like or wheel-shaped. Sizes range from one fifth of a centimetre to 15-30 cm.\nExcept for the \n cactus species that can be found across the tropics of the world, cacti are prevalent in the Americas but with their growing popularity, have been imported all over the world. Among the most common and well-known are Prickly Pears, Barrel cacti, Saguaro cacti (featuring in most Western films), Aztekium cacti, and Echinopsis a.k.a. the hedgehog cactus that can be found as houseplants on many window sills. \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage via \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nSource: \n, \n\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb64.webshots.com-42879-2422346610104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"10 Amazingly Beautiful Cactus Flowers","author":"Simone Preuss"}
