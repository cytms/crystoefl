{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/finding-nemo-sailfish/2153","content":"\nIn a one-off exclusive, with the kind permission of National Geographic and wildlife photographer Paul Nicklen, Environmental Graffiti present incredible images of the majestic sailfish.\n\n\nPhotographed fifty miles northeast of Isla Mujeres in the Gulf of Mexico, the sailfish prowl for sardines; a favorite morsel of theirs. Slicing through the blue open ocean, the sailfish work together to capture their next meal.\nSilvery-blue finned fencers swirl and eddy in ever-decreasing circles, packing their terrified prey into a bait ball, fresh for the killing. The sailfish, using superbly-organised tactics normally reserved for undercover commandos, carry out their planned approach with unbelievable speed and uncanny precision, communicating in a way only they know.\nThe agitated mass of sardines twist and turn as one in an attempt to escape their tormentors. Only the very clever – or the previously bullied – know to seek protection in the center of the mass, increasing their chances of survival, or prolonging the inevitable.\nJennifer S Holland, of National Geographic, writes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the \n in this month's National Geographic, September 2008, or visit \n.\n\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Flamingojpg","title":"Finding Nemo in Real Life!
