Perhaps your idea of a great holiday is landing the big one, out there on the sparkling waters, or better still, flying through the air at 60 miles an hour on board a roller coaster. We think vacations are all about freedom: the freedom to choose how you spend your time – and you’ll be hard pressed to find a destination that offers more possibilities than \n, Florida.\nYou could spend an exhilarating morning out there on the lakes, taking in nature and doing a bit of fishing. After a lakefront lunch and some down-time on the promenade, you could head to the beach to work on your tan and unwind, ready for a round of golf in the afternoon. By now you’ve worked up quite an appetite, so hit the town for a glitzy dinner and some jazz – the perfect refresher before an evening spent riding the roller coasters of a starry theme park.\n\n\nKissimmee seems to offer pretty much something for everyone, whether it's relaxation or adventure that you’re after – and its proximity to Florida’s famous theme parks mean there’ll be plenty for the kids too, from Disney theme parks to horseback riding in the wild.\nChoice so often makes or breaks a holiday destination – we love chilling by the beach, indulging in outdoor sports, catching some culture, and hitting the town - but we like to do what we want, when we want. Kissimmee's possibilities are endless: only an hour from the Atlantic, or two from the Gulf Coast.\n\n\nOn top of this, it's littered with lakes, trails and countryside perfect for everything from hiking to zip-lining, horseback riding to airboat trips. And if this all sounds too much, you could choose instead to check out the shops and restaurants in Kissimmee, or venture into one of the charmingly named nearby towns, such as St. Cloud or Celebration.\n\n\nThere are many resorts that claim they offer so much to do, your biggest challenge will be choosing what to do next – but with Kissimmee, this may well just be true. Check out Kissimmee’s possibilities \n, and see if it could be your dream vacation.\n ","web_category":"travel","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb58.webshots.com-43129-2265023440103830173S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Paradise is a Land Called Kissimmee","author":"Thomas Davie"}
