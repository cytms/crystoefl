Apparently the web, stretching 180 metres, is the result of millions of spiders working together, to the mystification of park rangers.\nThe web is proving effective in controlling the mosquito population.  Donna Garde, park superintendent, said that “There are times you can literally hear the screech of millions of mosquitoes caught in those webs.”\nEntomologist Professor John Jackman of A&amp;M University said that similar webs were reported every couple of years.  They are either created by social cobweb spiders working together, or by spiders spreading out from a central point.  He commented that “until we get some samples sent to us, we really won't know what species of spider we're talking about”.\nArachnid and insect specialists will be visiting the park to study the web firsthand.  \n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Brown-Reclusejpg","title":"Monster spider web discovered in Texas","author":"Maryking"}
