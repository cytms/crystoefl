For many years this location has been popular with tourists because of its incredible sights. The best time to visit Leh and Ladakh is between the months of May and September when the weather is pretty warm and you can enjoy the surroundings.

Imagine how beautiful the entire view would be. This park is spread over 55 miles and the beauty of its landscape is enhanced even more during the monsoon season when all the trees become lush green and the flowers appear brighter than ever. If you are planning to visit this place, the best time would be between July and August when you can explore the beautiful Valley of Flowers in full bloom. This place is good for hiking too, but when you hike, make sure you carry food with you and pack clothes just in case it rains - which it often does.\nWe all like to admire nature's beauty and one of the perfect places to enjoy nature is Nainital, which is surrounded by mountains.
