The energy produced is then stored in a battery that’s used to run the rest of the gym’s equipment, along with solar-power.\n, which opened September 1, joins a growing number human-powered gyms and includes includes state-of-the-art elliptical trainers and treadmills, which currently use 30% human-power and 70% solar-power, a yoga room with a cork floor and energy-saving ceiling fans are also in place.\nSimilar gyms are already in full swing in Hong Kong and California where fitness fanatics power the lights as well as the equipment.\nSource \n, ","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-i42.tinypic.com-2gua107.jpg","title":"Gym Generates Energy from Pedal Power","author":"Linda"}
