To start off with, it was probably a light joke, but as the “situation” gradually evolved, it got out of hand. She obviously didn’t find it that funny (who would) and called the police. A few minutes later, the officers arrived.The building superintendent opened the apartment door and the policemen went in to apprehend Rodriguez. Yet they were to face an ever weirder threat…\nWhen they entered the apartment, one officer claims that the 21 year old Rodriguez threatened them with the pet reptile, telling it to “Get them!”\nUnfortunately for Rodriguez, pet albino pythons are not very keen to follow orders and it preferred not to attack the policemen. Victor Rodriguez was charged disorderly conduct and with threatening police. He was sent to jail on a $10.000 bond and the python was brought to Bridgeport's animal control shelter.\nThe moral of the story is, if you’re stupid or nutty enough to want to get your pet to attack police, get a dog, ‘cus albino pythons ain’t worth it.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/4_constricting.jpg","title":"“Get them!
