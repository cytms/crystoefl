Most ships run on bunker fuel, which is cheap but a harmful pollutant.\n\"The international treaty process at the IMO (International Maritime Organization) has been a slow process by which consensus is reached, rather than a process by which a regulatory authority can set standards that an industry must agree to,\" said James Corbett, one of the authors of the study.\n\"So this study, we think, is important to help policy-makers determine the appropriate path forward as they consider new regulations for shipping,\" said Corbett, who is at the University of Delaware's College of Marine and Earth Studies.\nVia :: ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb29.webshots.com-24732-2041103860104391629S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Ship Emissions Cause 60,000 Deaths a Year","author":"Simmons"}
