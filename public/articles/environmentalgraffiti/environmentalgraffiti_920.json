Apparently all that is known is that the requirements were that the mice had to be female and weigh no more than 18 grams each.\nAn official from the service said \"Everyone is wondering what they are for. But if they were ordered then that means they are needed.\" The same official also refused to speculate what the mice were for, saying there were \"more important things to think about.\"\nAll of this is pretty strange. Of course, there are some plausible explanations: could  an elite army of loyal rodents be the natural choice against the numerous threats issued by elephants against the Kremlin?  Will the mice play a role in testing toxic and dangerous chemicals? Or are they there simply to feed the falcons, which are kept in the Kremlin to scare off crows?\nNonetheless, according to Reuters, the Kremlin has found a supplier and is going to be paying 475,776 roubles ($20,000) for the mice. Can anyone beat that?\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb19.webshots.com-10578-2551125970105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Kremlin Orders 3,200 Mice.
