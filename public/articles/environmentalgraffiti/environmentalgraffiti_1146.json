The cubs, Lenuta and Costel were born to six year old Gina and her mate Geo.  They now weigh three kilos each.\nSiberian Tigers are perilously close to extinction.  Native to Russia and northern China, their numbers have fallen to as little as three hundred due to hunting and loss of habitat.  Prospects are improving for the tiger, however.  There were as few as fifty remaining in the wild in the 1930s, but poaching has been brought under control and numbers have increased.  The Chinese government also plans to release six hundred captive bred tigers into the wild from the Hengdaohezi Feline Breeding Centre later this year.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/cuteyjpg","title":"Endangered Tiger Cubs Born in Romania","author":"tom lyttelton"}
