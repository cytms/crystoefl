This has led scientists to believe that the trees are a chemical message post of sorts-- the bears can communicate their status to one another easily without having to come into contact.\nThis is seemingly reinforced by the fact that females with cubs stay away  from the trees and don't engage in this behavior; it's important that they stay out of the hearts and minds of males who might want to breed with them, who would attack their cubs.\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/cuteyjpg","title":"The Reason Behind The Bear Dance","author":"whatsrequired"}
