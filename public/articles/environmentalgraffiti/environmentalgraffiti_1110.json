British Columbia’s forests have had around 40% of their trees wiped out by the insects, according to a report issued on Monday.\nThe report by British Columbia's Ministry of Forests highlights the fact that the infestation has decimated over 530 million cubic metres of wood over a period of eight years, which is around 40% of the region’s supply of commercial lumber.\nThe beetles have traditionally feasted on pine for thousands of years. However, nature has controlled their spread through extreme weather and forest fires. This year, global warming seems to be the culprit responsible for the increase in pine beetle population.\nIt’s not all bad news however.\n said:","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/JARDINE-JUNIPER","title":"Voracious beetles Wipe out 9 million hectares of pine trees","author":"Chris"}
