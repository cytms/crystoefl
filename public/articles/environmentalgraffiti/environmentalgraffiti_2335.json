The number of people affected by these disasters has risen 68%, from an average of 174 million between 1985 and 1994 to 254 million from 1995 to 2004.\n\"This year we have seen floods in South Asia, across the breadth of Africa and Mexico that have affected more than 250 million people,\" said Oxfam's director Barbara Stocking.\n\"This is no freak year. It follows a pattern of more frequent, more erratic, more unpredictable and more extreme weather events that are affecting more people. Action is needed now to prepare for more disasters otherwise humanitarian assistance will be overwhelmed and recent advances in human development will go into reverse,\" Stocking said.\nVia :: \n ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/heq_0.jpg","title":"Report: Weather Disasters Have Increased 400%","author":"Simmons"}
