But with all that suggestive material out there on the Net, what can we do? After going through hundreds of naughty pics, here’s our very own Top 11 of phallic buildings. It’s a dirty job but someone’s gotta do it… \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nNorwegian artist Gustav Vigeland certainly had something on his mind when carving this monolith, which can be seen at Frognerpark in Oslo.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nHere's a naughty tomb at a cemetery in Metairie, Louisiana. \n\nImage: \nThe next picture doesn't leave much to the imagination. It is the Yangyuanshi pillar in the Danxia Shan mountains, a national park in Shaoguan, Guangdong province, China. If you ever visit, there's also the female counterpart to our picture here. \n\nImage: \nThe next picture had us speechless. What were they thinking? And what are they trying to communicate with this monument? Strange birds united under phallic hats? It sure is in a scenic location and any hints to its whereabout are appreciated.\n\nImage via \nThe Leaning Tower of Pisa should be in its own category because it has let people's imagination run wild since the beginning of its construction in the 12th century. Now, one is almost expected to have some fun with the good-natured monument. \n\nImage: \n30 St Mary Axe a.k.a. The Gherkin certainly throws many thought processes off track. Just search for phallic buildings online and you'll find many like-minded people. The 180m-tall tower was designed by Norman Foster and has confused Londoners ever since its opening in 2004. We like its suggestive shape.   \n\nImage via \nThe Agbar Tower in Barcelona and The Gherkin could be brothers. The former sure has been called many things – fountain, suppository, vibrator and what not but for us and many Internet users, it just looks distinctly phallic. In fact, its shape is so distracting that one forgets that this 32-storey tower is – at 142 m – one of Spain’s tallest buildings. The tower’s surface panels were painted in 40 different colours, which is why the façade seems to change colour depending on the time of the day.    \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nAnd here, our No. 1 – the Washington Monument. Chosen because it's a clear internet favorite in the naughty category. Speaking of which – you gotta love this cheeky pic.  \n\nImage: \n\nImage via \n","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb20.webshots.com-45715-2067462300105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"11 Most Suggestive Structures on Earth","author":"Simone Preuss"}
