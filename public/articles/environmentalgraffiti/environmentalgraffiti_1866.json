In the course of our busy lives this year, we will throw out more than two million tons of polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles – an unintended byproduct of our everyday convenience.”\nThe aims of the bottle house are simple:\n\n\nThe Bottle House was on show at Seattle's Music and Art Festival, \n, which ran from 31 August to 1 September this year.\nSource \n,","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb17.webshots.com-43984-2380224670104178106S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Amazing House Created Entirely from Plastic Bottles","author":"Linda"}
