Sounds bizarre? Well, that’s probably because it is.\nMusician Terje Isungset has been carving his chilly instruments from ice for the past 20 years. Many moons ago, the budding percussionist, not content with experimenting on stone and glass, decided to use what was available around him, and being Norwegian that happened to be ice. But not just any old ice, Insungset chips away at a 2,500-year-old glacier:\n\n\nThe premise for the drastic change in instrument came after being disillusioned with life as a drummer.\nTo do this, Isungset decided the only way he could escape normal music traditions was to change the instruments, as well as the way he approached the music. Now, Isungest’s musical talents are in high demand. He has recorded five ‘ice’ albums and often plays to international audiences.\nHis latest show, Cinderella is currently showing at \n in London. For this he created an ice trumpet, which he plays along with a glass drum kit, bicycle wheel and his faithful mouth organ made of metal from a WWII German bomber.\n is playing until January 3, 2009.\nSource \n, \n\n","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Planecrashcity.jpg","title":"The Orchestra Made of Ice","author":"Linda"}
