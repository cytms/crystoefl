On Thursday, \n by a grizzly while hiking in the Shoshone National Forest six miles east of Yellowstone. But it is the grisly Memorial Day weekend incident at Alaska’s Denali National Park that is testing a new national policy and renewing a debate over firearms. That’s because in addition to hikers and an angry bear, it also involved a .45-caliber pistol.\nAn unidentified male backpacker \n in defense of his female hiking companion on May 28, park officials have reported. The shooter claims to have used his weapon when the bear charged forward. After being shot, the animal retreated into the brush and was later found dead 100ft from the site of the shooting near Denali’s Tattler Creek at the west end of Igloo Canyon. The matter is under review to determine whether a crime took place.\nThe incident is being scrutinized with particular attention, because this is the first case of gunfire at a national park since \n was enacted in February regulating the use of guns on park lands. \n, signed by President Obama in May 2009, allows firearms in 373 of the country’s 392 parks, including the original section of Denali, in accordance with state permit guidelines. Despite these new allowances, however, hunting laws are unchanged and it remains generally illegal to discharge a gun, making the situation more than a little complicated. “This person was doing something legally in terms of carrying the weapon,” Parks Information Officer \n, referring to the gunman. “What is not legal – and this has been a federal regulation for a long time – is the use of the weapon.”\nAs the investigation continues, the National Association for Gun Rights, a gun advocacy group, has already drawn its conclusion, asserting emphatically \n: “If firearms were still outlawed in national parks, both of these hikers would probably be dead.” Yet the park service provides some context by citing the statistic that there have only been \n of bear attacks in Denali, and no mauling has been fatal. \n that pepper spray is a more effective tool for deterring bears. Those who come in contact with a threatening bear are instructed to wave their arms and to speak in a low voice while backing away.\nIt hasn’t taken long for the wisdom of the new law to be tested. Consider this the first shot. Whether this event underscores the need for weapons in parks or serves as a case of abuse of that privilege remains unclear for now. The matter is currently before the US attorney’s office, though prosecution is unlikely, according to Chris Pergiel, the regional chief ranger for the National Parks Service Alaska region.
