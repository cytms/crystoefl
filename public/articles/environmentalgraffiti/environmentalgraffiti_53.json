{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-amazing-termite-mounds","content":"\nAustralia has one of the most diverse range of termite mounds in the world. Even more amazingly, three quarters of Australian termite species live totally unseen, either living in trees or hiding underground.\nThe shape of these mounds is evidence of the termites' adept climate control, exposing the least possible surface area to Northern Australia's blistering sun at any one time.\nTermite mounds can grow up to 25ft tall. In order for a human to build a comparative structure it would need to be 4,600ft tall.\nTermite mounds vary in size and shape due to environmental factors like soil and climate. All of them, however, include some kind of in-built climate control which is affected by their shape.\nScientists are studying the mound's system of temperature control, recycling and structure in order apply them to emerging green technologies.\nAncient African civilizations used mounds to locate gold deposits. Termites would drag up various minerals from the soil beneath them as they built, giving an indication of the riches that lay buried beneath.\nTermites play a particularly important role in Northern Australia, breaking down vegetation in amounts equivalent to some large mammals in other countries.\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/485404025497ec5788f6zjpg","title":"The Beauty and Brilliance of Termite Mound Architecture","author":"Yohani Kamarudin"}
