Their plans will introduce a more organic feel to the bustling city center:\n\n\n\n\nIt certainly sounds impressive but with all that foliage we wonder how they’ll manage to keep the re-growth under control. At least it will provide a few green-fingered residents with work!\nSource \n ","web_category":"outdoor","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/1polejpg","title":"Beijing's Amazing Urban Forest","author":"Linda"}
