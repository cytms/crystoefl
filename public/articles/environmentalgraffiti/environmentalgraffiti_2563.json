{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/lifestyle/news-dog-house","content":"\nPutting a new spin on the meaning of ‘in the dog house’ is a large 12 foot canine that cunningly disguises a B&amp;B. \nThe Dog Bark Park Inn is located in Cottonwood, Idaho, in the heart of the Camas Prairie, and was created by ‘chainsaw artists’ Dennis and Frances.\nNot only will your photo album be forever enriched with snaps of ‘the world’s tallest beagle’, but you can also boast of having ‘really got inside a dog’s mind’ by bedding down in the loft space inside its head.\nA private deck on the second story is how you enter into the belly of the beast - literally. And if once inside you forget where you are, the 26 carved dogs on the headboard of the queen bed will swiftly remind you.\nAfter a day jet boating in Hell’s Canyon, visiting a wolf centre or going horse riding, a canine shaped complimentary cookie on the pillow will stave off your hunger while you watch the stars from the private deck. \nDon’t forget to pay a visit to the Chainsaw Kennels before you leave in order to pick up your very own wooden doggy keepsake. Dennis and Frances will even work from a photo of your pooch to create something more personal. Now that really takes the biscuit.\n\n","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/the-peacefulman.jpg","title":"The Only Dog-Shaped Hotel  on Earth","author":"katix138"}
