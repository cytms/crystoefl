After the lions were killed he buried the carcasses in deep pits to avoid detection. Suspicion about the missing lions led the police to his doorstep.\nGir National Park, in the province of Gujarat in western India, is home to around 350 Asiatic lions and is the last home for this beautiful big cat, which was hunted to extinction in almost all of Asia at the turn of the last century. The few lions that survived in this part of the world were protected by the establishment of the Gir National Park in 1965, and their population has increased from 177 in 1968 to more than 350 in 2005.\nIts success in breeding lions couldâ€™ve been better if not for the conflicts that the lions have with local farmers over space. The lions are also constantly preyed upon by poachers. The irony of the whole situation is that the Indian state cannot even protect the lion which is the national emblem of India!","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Flamingojpg","title":"Five Lions Fried to Death in India","author":"Chris"}
