Surreal? Yes. Photoshopped? Never. Just the incredible interplay of fog, skyscrapers and sunlight that seems to play tricks with our eyes. Some cities like Dubai, Vancouver and San Francisco just have all the ingredients for stunning fogfloater pics.\n\nImage: \nWhat is the difference between fog and cloud cover? Fog is also a cloud, just a really low one that touches the ground. Its formation has to do with various factors, one being the difference between temperature and dew point: If it is less than 2.5 °C (4 °F), fog begins to form and water vapour condenses into minuscule water droplets.\n\nImage: \nIn addition, water requires a non-gaseous surface like dust, pollutants, aerosols or salt to transform from vapour to liquid. Because of the high salt content in the air, coastal regions are often foggy – San Francisco being a famous example.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nPlaces where cold and warm air and water meet are also fog prone; so are valleys that trap warmer or more polluted air, therefore encouraging fog formation upon hitting cooler air or a certain temperature. Dubai, for example, located on the Persian Gulf Coast yet also within the Arabian Desert is prone to fog that blankets the city, letting only its many skyscrapers peek through in a spectacular fashion.\n\nImage via \n\nImage via \nVancouver is another city whose geography makes it fog prone: Vancouver is located between Burrard Inlet to the north, Fraser River to the south and the North Shore Mountains that dominate the cityscape. On a foggy day, the view from one of the nearby mountain tops is spectacular.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n, used with permission\n\nImage via \nDid you know that there is a difference between fog and mist? A thin one, literally: A dense cloud that reduces visibility to under 1 km is called fog; a slightly less dense cloud that produces visibility anywhere from 1 km to 2 km is called mist. In the last three pictures, we're clearly looking at fog, not mist.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Echelmanjpg","title":"Steel Giants Floating on a Blanket of Fog","author":"Simone Preuss"}
