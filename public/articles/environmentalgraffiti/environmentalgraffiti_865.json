No, like something from a cartoon or an indoor Pamplona bull festival, a German family were left gob-smacked when one of the beasts charged into their house through the back door and took a full tour of the building before leaving by the front door.\nThe bull, which completely destroyed the furnishings of the house, did not injure any of the family members, but did cause 10,000 euros (15,000 USD) worth of damage.\nSo how did the bull get there?\nThe animal was part of an escaped herd of cattle, which invaded the nearby town of  Monschau. With no cowboys to reel them in, they wreaked havoc.\nUnfortunately, the sad part of the story is that the bull which was on the run didn’t make it to the finish line: he was shot in true Bonnie-and-Clyde-style by a huntsman.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/inca-quill-face.jpg","title":"Bull Charges Through Home and Exits Through Front Door","author":"Chris"}
