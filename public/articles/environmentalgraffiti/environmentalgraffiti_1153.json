Previously, melting ice sheets were seen as the major contributor to potential sea level rises; however, scientists in the online journal Science, have just published research suggesting that melting glaciers will pose a far greater threat this century.\nThe amount of water frozen in glaciers is only equivalent to 1% of that in the great ice sheets; however, ice melt from glaciers will probably account for at least 60% of sea level rise over the next one hundred years.  They alone will cause a rise of around 10 inches.\nGlaciers are already melting at an alarming rate.  The Rhone Glacier in Valais, Switzerland has receded 2.5km in a century, whilst the Ururashraju Glacier in the Peruvian Andes is now half a kilometre smaller than it was in 1992.  A recent study also revealed that Alaskan glaciers are melting at twice the rate previously thought.
