Yes, \n and it's final. When the barge comes to rest at the Speyer Technical Museum, Buran won't ever move again.\nBuran, which entered orbit once while unmanned and had been on display at the Sydney 2000 Olympics, is almost a visual carbon copy of the U.S. workhorse. However, it was sabotaged by the scarcity of funding available in the last days of the Soviet Union.\nWith any luck the cursed existence of the craft is over although some concern has been expressed by officials over the ungainly nature of the three-barge raft being used and even low-clearance bridges.","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb47.webshots.com-45550-2734100400105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Soviet Space Shuttle Makes Record Trip","author":"whatsrequired"}
