Today however, Friday 13th June 2008 is the day the well-known American brand makes history: Doritos has teamed up with astronomers to broadcast their advertising into space. The ad is being pulsed over a 6-hour period from the radars of the EISCAT European space station in the Arctic Circle.\nThe transmission is part of a bigger project entitled the Doritos Broadcast Project, during which the company invited the UK public to produce a snap-shot of life on Earth to be sent into space. The winning ad \"Tribe\", as voted by the British public, is directed by 25-year-old Matt Bowron. Watch it below:\n\n\nThe ad depicts a tribe of Doritos escaping from the pack and sacrificing a member of their tribe to the God of Salsa. The ad is available online, at the Doritos website, and will be broadcasted on ITV, during the Euro 2008 semi-final game on Sunday 15th June @ 7.44pm.\nEISCAT Director, Professor Tony van Eyken who oversaw the transmission said: “The signal is directed at a solar system just 42 light years away from Earth, in the ‘Ursa Major’ or Great Bear Constellation. Its star is very similar to our Sun and hosts a habitable zone that could harbour small life supporting planets similar to ours.”\nIt's an historic day for all of us. No doubt about it. We must ask ourselves - what will ET think when it receives a broadcast about some dancing potato chips? Let’s just hope we don’t get invaded.","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/PIA15283jpg","title":"Breaking: The Ad That's Going into Space","author":"Bogdan"}
