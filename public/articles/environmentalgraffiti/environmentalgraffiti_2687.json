Religious leaders urging their followers to do more to save the environment came in at number two. Number one was massive improvements in energy efficient electrical goods.\nAccording to Nick Reeves, executive director of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, which helped the agency create the list: \"The world's faith groups have been silent for too long on the environment. It is time they fulfilled their rightful collective role in reminding us that we have a duty to restore and maintain the ecological balance of the planet.\"\nHe continued: “Most faith groups do have environmental policies and there is a lot going on in the background, but they need to be more vociferous in getting their message across because they speak for millions and millions of people. There needs to be a stronger campaigning aspect to their work.\"\nThe leaders of 6 major religious groups traveled to the Arctic this summer to pray for the planet.  The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, leader of the Orthodox Christian Church, met with Catholic and Protestant leaders, the Grand Rabbi of Paris, Sunni and Shia Islam scholars, and Hindu, Shinto, and Zen Buddhist leaders. The Pope sent a message of support. Bartholomew said the group had prayed \"for the planet and for the Earth, for salvation of life and heart, for the coming generation, and for Creation\"\nSource: ","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/temple10.jpg","title":"Jesus Saves...The Planet","author":"Chris"}
