The subway cars are being placed on top of a old viaducts located on reclaimed land. The space will also include a 4,000 square-foot warehouse that will be used as a performance, art and cultural center.\nThe seats have been pulled out to provide adequate workspace and the interiors are getting a complete makeover using sustainable materials. Energy will be provided by carbon neutral resources, such as solar power, and there will be an environmentally-friendly roof-top garden. Not only that but green-fingered artists who grow vegetables on site may even get a free lunch - not something you hear everyday in old London Town.\nFor more info on The Village Underground, check out \n.","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb24.webshots.com-44055-2359028470104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Welcome to the Village Underground","author":"kwbridge"}
