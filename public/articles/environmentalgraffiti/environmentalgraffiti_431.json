Porcupines are Friendly\nStinkers, the 5-year-old porcupine seen above, currently lives at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, which is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving Alaska’s wildlife through public education.\n, Stinkers lived at Colorado's famous Telluride Ski Resort, where visitors viewed her as friendly but insanely hungry. Her voracious hunger eventually caused her to need a new home after she started biting people’s fingers.\nWhile in Colorado, Stinkers liked interacting with the skiers, however, porcupines are generally anti-social and lead pretty solitary lives.\n\n\n, porcupines eat lots of trees, foliage and other vegetation. They can be destructive. As you can see, Stinkers loves corn on the cob:\n\n\nPorcupines are found throughout western and northern North America. Adult porcupines, sometimes called “porkies” or “quill pigs,” are generally about 30 inches long. Each one has about 30,000 sharp, barbed quills covering its back.
