It proved to be life-changing experience. She traveled to the volcanic island of Lanzarote, where she painted in craters and the idea to paint on site was born. Now, Ulrike travels to remote locations to create abstractÂ  works on canvas, using pigments from the earth. \nShe is a process artist. In her work, the creation and structure are integral parts of the same process. Her choice of materials shows the deteriorating effect of time. She pounds soil into dust, mixes it with oil and wax and, finally, transfers it to her canvas by hand. \nThe rest of her work is left to natural forces: time, gravity, temperature and atmosphere. Her earthworks are organic, feminine and eternal. She intergrates systems of nature into art. Arnold's work formalizes the interest in entropy, while creating an aesthetic experience.\nHer work recreated geological landscapes of Armenia, Africe and India. But the most special for her is Utah with its canyons and strong earthy colors. Sensitive to the immensity of American landscape, she gives it archeological and lyrical character.\nShe tries to penetrate unknown and simultaneously pursue pictorial effectst in a decorative manner. Currently, Arnold is working in her studio in Duesseldorf on a series consisting of \"stardust\" material form meteorites, which she gets from her scientist friend.
