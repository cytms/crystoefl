Found in trees, this snake has a tail that is prehensile, meaning it can grip around tree branches. Steve Backshall, who present the TV show \n, from BBC Earth, brings us a fantastic video showing how incredibly quickly these vipers can strike their target.\n\n\nThe eyelash pit viper has small modified scales on top of its eyes that look like lashes, and like all pit vipers has heat sensing organs (pits) between its nostrils and eyes. This way it can tell simply from temperature when to reach out to strike animals flying or running past. It is an ambush predator and will even return to the same spot every year to ambush migrating birds. It is found throughout South America.\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/BlackWidow.jpg","title":"The Deadly Eyelash Pit Viper Strikes!","author":"Michele Collet"}
