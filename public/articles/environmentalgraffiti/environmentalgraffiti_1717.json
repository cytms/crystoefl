{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/product-design/news-colorful-philippine-jeepney","content":"\nOne of the first things you'll notice upon leaving the airport and journeying out into the streets of Manila is the jeepney. \nBursting with colour, flashy graphics, decorative ornaments and more often than not - crazy driving, it is one of the cheapest forms of transportation in the country.\nFashioned out of military jeeps left by the U.S. troops back in World War 2, but no longer resembling any form of militariness, the jeepney has become one of the cultural symbols of the country, often appearing in paintings by well-known Philippine master artists, commercial ads on TV and print, and local souvenirs.  \nFor as low as US 20 cents per ride, jeepneys have become the creative solution for the much needed public transportation, both in the busy city streets and out in the country where sometimes, even the roof becomes your seat.\nIt is used to transport cargo as well. \nThe not-so-humble jeepney is often referred to as \"King of the Road\", mainly because the drivers pause as they please - at the request of the unconcerned passenger who desires to step down at any point on the street they wish, as they know that jeeps can get away with disobeying traffic rules. It's a culturally accepted delinquency, that irks other drivers and puzzles everyone - including the traffic enforcers.\nThe flamboyant decoration of jeepneys though cannot hide the fact that they run on diesel and are some of the worst smoke belchers on the street. Entertaining as they are, let's hope that the electric jeepney becomes the future \"King of the Road\".\n\n","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb12.webshots.com-41099-2004351140103830173S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"The Colorful Philippine Jeepney","author":"eve"}
