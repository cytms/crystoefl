He states that global warming is currently partially offset by global dimming, a cooling of 2-3 ?C caused by atmospheric industrial pollution.\nLovelock is skeptical of the IPCC’s most recent report, which he calls cautious.  He believes it gives the false impression that global warming is reversible with immediate action. Lovelock’s own view is somewhat apocalyptic. He suggests that 6 to 8 billion people will face crises over food and water supplies while battling an intolerable climate.\nLovelock does have some suggestions on how to improve the situation. He suggests cutting greenhouse gas emissions anyway, as they may slow the pace of global warming.  He also advocates saving natural forests. He still believes, however, that humans will have to adapt to the inevitable changes global warming will bring.\nSource: \n and ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Global-Warming-effectsjpg","title":"Top Scientist Says We're Screwed","author":"Chris"}
