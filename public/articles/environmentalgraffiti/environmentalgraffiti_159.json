Monk seals have almost disappeared from the main Hawaiian Islands and have numerous threats to their existence. However, the good news is that new protected habitats have been proposed.\nMonk seals are not only dying due to the threat of sharks, but also because of man-made dangers in the form of encounters with fishing nets and a cat parasite that is washed into the ocean in sewage runoffs. It's also dying of starvation, with only one in five seals able to make it to adulthood. \nMiyoko Sakashita, Oceans Director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said: “New habitat protections, including all of the Hawaiian Islands, are essential to bring endangered Hawaiian monk seals back from the brink of extinction... The proposal to protect Hawaii’s coastline for monk seals is a landmark decision that will benefit seals and the coastal environment for generations.”\nSource: \n, ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Island9.jpg","title":"Critically Endangered Hawaiian Monk Seals to Receive Habitat Protections","author":"Michele Collet"}
