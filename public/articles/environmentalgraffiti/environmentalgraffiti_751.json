What they lack in grace, they make up for in fervour, especially when it comes to putting someone in their place. But see for yourself; we promise it wonâ€™t be a wild goose chase.  \nMany birds like ducks and swans belong to the goose family (\n) but only those in the \n subfamily and the \n tribe are considered true geese. There are three true geese categories: Anser or Grey Geese to which the domesticated goose also belongs; Chen or White Geese; and Branta or Black Geese, for example the Canada Goose.  \n\nImage: \nLike sheep, geese were among the earliest animals to be domesticated and are popular for their meat, eggs and down feathers. Archeological evidence from Egypt proves that domesticated geese already existed 5,000 years ago. \nThe most common breeds are the Embden and Toulouse geese, which are said to be offshoots of the Sebastopol Goose, introduced in Western Europe in 1856. \nCompared to wild geese, domesticated geese are much plumper with a bigger rear that forces them to take up a more upright posture, while also preventing them from flying. Their plumage has changed from dark brown tones that blend in with their environment to often pure white.   \nGeese behaviour often seems involuntarily funny. Landing, for example, is not the most graceful sight to behold; here are a few examples.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nFor centuries, domestic geese have been used as watch animals because they are not only chatty but also among the most aggressive of all poultry. Looking at the next goose pictures, one is not hard pressed to believe it. \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nBut then again, geese can be in high spirits and go prancing around, too...\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nWe hope that this little tour-de-goose has shown what versatile animals geese are. \n\nImage via \n\nImage: \nSource: \n, ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb34.webshots.com-42273-2144065590104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Release the Geese!","author":"Simone Preuss"}
