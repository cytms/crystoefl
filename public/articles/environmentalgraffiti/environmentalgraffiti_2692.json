{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/skinny-pig/358","content":"\nThe latest celebrity must have is no longer the yappy doggy,but a hairless guinea pig, known affectionately as ‘\n.’ Originally bred for testing the Hartley stock at the Eastman Kodak Company in 1979, these little piggies went on to become the most sought after of pets. Completely bald apart from a little moustache, they’re the ideal pet for an allergy infested consumer.\nUnsurprisingly they need regular moisturising, as their skin dries out quickly, and they require sunscreen in the summer to avoid burning. Luckily, they can be easily styled as they love a warm jumper in the winter months, but eat three times as much as their hairy counterpart in their attempt to keep warm. Regardless of these obvious difficulties, Skinny lovers are still willing to pay up to £150 for these little darlings.\nDemand is currently outstripping supply, and traditional breeders are making a stand against an animal who needs sunscreen and a sweatshirt to survive. With an increase in designer pets, \n being the a firm favourite, where will it stop? Personally I’m holding onto my pennies for the tabletop elephant – it’s bound to come along sooner or later.","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/800px-Sphinx_1.jpg","title":"Skinny Pig","author":"emma"}
