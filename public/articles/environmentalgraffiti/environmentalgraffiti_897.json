This has resulted in but one conclusion for the time being: the comb jellyfish came first. This may seem improbable because the jellyfish has connective tissues and a nervous system, unlike the sea sponge. It also may imply that the less complex version of the sponge, and therefore the rest of life, would have evolved from the more complex jelly.\nThat possibility alone is certain to get miles of play from the intelligent design and creationist crowds, who have managed to forestall the teaching of actual biology in American high schools for years.\nWith the possibility of scientists having to regroup a bit, one would expect a renewed offensive.
