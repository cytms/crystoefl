How have the members of the \n family earned their name?\n\nMost assassin bugs deserve the name because they live by killing to eat. Some families are even known for what they eat: ants, spiders and termites are prey for three separate families. \nWhat, an insect that eats spiders? Yes! This amazing \n (although a bit slow to get started) shows the \"Strumming Assassin\" luring a tangle-web spider to its death.\nOther assassin bug families are willing to kill a wider range of prey. As an example, the milkweed assassin bug dines on a variety of insects, including stink bugs, flies and aphids.\n\nOther ssassin bugs do not quite live up to their name. \"Kissing bugs\" or \n merely drink blood. Kissing bugs usually nest with wood rats in the United States, although most \n sub-species live in Central or South America. Attracted to light, these insects will feed on human blood and can transmit diseases such as Chagas disease (\n or sleeping sickness). The bites also cause allergic reactions in about 7% of their human victims.\n \nThese insects go through egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs have no wings, and must molt several times before becoming adults with wings. However, most are poor fliers. They generally hunt by stealth and surprise.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) considers the assassin bug to be a beneficial insect since it preys on pests such as the tomato hornworm. They recommend planting permanent shelters, such as hedgerows, to encourage further generations of \n to breed and protect farms and gardens.\nSimilar sentiments are expressed by the Galveston County Master Gardeners who point to bushes, trees and even weeds as shelters for these beneficial predatory insects.\n\nOn the other hand, kissing bugs are pestilential pests in southern California and should be reported to \n (via \n). This family of assassin bugs seems unlikely to live in gardens and would not reap the benefits that their insectovore relatives may receive from helpful herbalists.\n:\nC. Weirauch, U.
