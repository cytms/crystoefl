And you wouldn’t blame him, but his father assured him it was all perfectly safe (even though he had bought extra insurance on the hire car “just in case”).\nA Tesla coil was placed on top of the car with a rod projecting out and bent towards the ground, from which the sparks would fly. A wooden counterweight was then placed on top to make sure it stayed in place. When the electric current was switched on and the rod turned to encircle the car, under long exposure the results are electrifying.\nSource ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/storm12a_0.jpg","title":"The Best Burglar Alarm in History","author":"Linda"}
