Feed me a fish – ork! Ork!\nYet they still know the joy of playing even when they're adults:\n\n•\tDive deep – oh, see that turtle? Chase it! Tag it! Nose it up to the surface – now flip it up in the air!\n\n•\tSwim, arch back and touch nose to tail. Blow a bubble – follow it up to the surface, watch it burst!\n\n•\tGrab a strand of seaweed, carry it to the beach. Toss it around, let it fall. Pick it up, drag it to the water. Gone!\nWhen the female Harbor seals are ready for breeding (meaning their pups are newly-weaned), the males \"gather underwater, turn belly-side up, put their heads together and vocalize\" (\n). \n. \nEleven months later, the pups are born – one pup per female. While the male Harbor Seals \"discuss\" who's the biggest and baddest, the mothers alternate between fishing, beach-sunbathing, rolling on their backs to expose their bellies so their baby can nurse, and sleeping.\nSometimes \n (no, it isn't instinctive like flying is to birds), the mother will let her pup stay on her back while she dives.\nMost Harbor Seals stay relatively close to land, hauling out onto beaches, rocky slabs, even buoys and docks. \n the most – particularly herring, flounder, anchovy and codfish. The males can weigh up to about 308 pounds; females up to 175 pounds.\nHarbor seals can live as long as 30 years or more.\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Island9.jpg","title":"The Seal: One of  the Cutest Animals on Earth","author":"dorothydot"}
