The 1994 quake killed 72 people, injured 9,000, and caused $25 Billion in damage, but earthquake tolls largely depend on where they strike-- a 7.1 quake struck in 1999, but was in the middle of the desert, and generated little fuss.\nThis study represents a far more comprehensive approach to earthquake prediction than previous examinations-- in earlier years, the science would focus on a small area, and usually use different methodologies, making the data difficult to assimilate.  By studying the entire state, and then breaking down regions and cities, the new data is far more easily indexed and referenced.","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb16.webshots.com-42447-2846367760105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"California is Screwed:  Major Quake by 2037","author":"whatsrequired"}
