{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/robo-jellyfish/3559","content":"\nOne of our lovely readers brought this amazing video to our attention and we think it’s so fantastic we just had to share it with you – a little something for the weekend:\nInspired by one of the most misunderstood animals of the marine world – the graceful jellyfish, leading electronics company, Festo have designed and created a pneumatic version of the gelatinous creature that moves remarkably like the real thing. There have been a number of other versions floating about over the past few years but none that have caught our attention quite as much as this mechanical offering.\n\n\nFesto explain how the technological wonder, called Aquajelly, works:\n\n\nThe ultimate idea is to have a number of the robots autonomously working together via a short-range radio and LED system so that the group of Aquajellys imitate real life. Fascinating stuff.\nCheck out \n for more wicked wonders of the robotic world.\nSource \n, \n\n","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/clouds2.jpg","title":"All Hail Robo-Jellyfish!","author":"Linda"}
