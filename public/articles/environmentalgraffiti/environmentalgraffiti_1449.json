It consists of two basic frames, split into two halves, with a triangular structure to stop it over-flexing. An outer frame slots over the top and both halves are then welded together.\nCreator, Matt says:\n\n\nIt’s not clear whether this new-age creation would be more environmentally-friendly that an aluminium-framed bike but we’ll certainly be ready and willing testers, cycling shorts a-go-go, when the first one rolls off the production line.\n ","web_category":"outdoor","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/2448215950_ac985c81dc.jpg","title":"Introducing the Recyclable Plastic Bicycle","author":"Linda"}
