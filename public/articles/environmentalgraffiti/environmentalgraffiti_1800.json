Cardboard toilet paper rolls are one medium for his creative expression, but he has also worked with pizza boxes, McDonald’s bags, flags and more.\nOn his \n, Teruya writes:\nWith no materials added and nothing taken away, Teruya cultivates miniature forests using his own deft skill and simple tools to cut out the shapes and fold the paper into place. What was once a tree is arboreally reborn. And if, like less privileged paper products, these art works are ever disposed of, they will help to fertilise future forests.\nSuch works are part of Teruya’s wider project of transforming the meaning of commonplace items in order to explore wider issues in contemporary culture.
