This is, of course, a reflection of the demand in a market where the creatures aren't occurring naturally, suppliers struggling to keep up, and some of the most creative and opportunistic thieves of all time.\nThey are of course profiteers, but also other keepers attempting to cover for their own shortages in business dealings and ensure that the pollination of large areas of trees will carry on unhindered.  All of that said...how can bees possibly be the most vulnerable target of opportunity in California?  Or is this truly a case of beekeeper turning against beekeeper?\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb38.webshots.com-13861-2373530570105960926S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Black Market Bees:  Stealing Hives, The New Fad","author":"whatsrequired"}
