In an \n, Denis has explained his photography:\n\"I like the creativity of the water and like to be surprised. I have taken thousands of photos of reflections and they are all unique.\"\nHe continues: \"The reflections are generally of trees, wild flowers, weeds, wild vegetation, the sky and the clouds.\"\nTalking about the challenges, Denis says: \"But the photo changes depending on the wind, the light, the stream, the level of the river and sometimes the depth of the river. It always fascinates me.\"\n\"The water ripples make them look like oil paintings by Van Gogh, Turner, Riopelle or Monet,\" he says.\n\n\nEvery morning, Denis takes a walk through his woods and to his river where he will \"follow the light walking along my wild river bank on my little piece of this planet.\" \nWithout fail, every day he will capture a piece of his planet in his lens, be it a reflection in the water or the leaves in a tree to share with the world. 100,000 people visited to look at one of his favorite photos when it was posted (the top one in the article), and Al Gore's office added themselves as a contact to his profile when they saw it.\n  \nTo see more of Denis Collette's stunning work, go to his \n. His work is also for sale at \n (it made my Christmas decisions easy) for very reasonable prices, approximately $45 including tax. He will happily upload any photo you like.\n","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/6_southport.jpg","title":"When Reflections in Water are Like Impressionist Paintings","author":"Michele Collet"}
