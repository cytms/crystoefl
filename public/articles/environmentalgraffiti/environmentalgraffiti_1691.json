Every day, there is a line around the block from Louis Vuitton just to see this particular store, even though there are countless others. \nThis spring, however, lines and crowds were forming for a very different reason. The Champs Elysees has gone green! Paris, never a city to be against the trend, has welcomed artist Gad Well and his exhibit \"Nature Capitale\" to fill the entirety of the avenue with a variety of greenery and flowers. \nThis event was put on by French farmers in an attempt to bring awareness to how much their industry is now struggling because of the poor economy. City folk don't often think about where their veggies come from while they're sitting at a cafe having lunch, but it's hard to miss the point when walking down this grand shopping center feeling as if you're walking through a forest.\nRather than being a negative protest of the public's attitude or the farmers' treatment, this installation was instead a celebration of everything green and of the local fare. Passersby could find everything from salad greens to pigs and sheep in this two-day exhibit that ran from May 23rd to 24th.
