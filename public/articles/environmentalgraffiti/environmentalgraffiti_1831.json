Only not all of them have a renowned design studio hiding in the wings.\nDomison, a high-end furniture retailer based in Montreal revealed their secret weapon in the window wars just recently. They commissioned design outfit \n to produce a seasonal installation, and the result is pretty spectacular, with an environmental edge.\nOver 300 recycled mineral glass water bottles were pieced together to create this magical Christmas installation. The bottles, containing the \n insignia, were hung at various heights to give the impression of a tree, and were lit from above by eight powerful spotlights, so when the light bounces off the bottles, they sparkle and glow as if made of ice.\nThe installation will be displayed until January 2009.\nSource \n\n","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb39.webshots.com-42662-2234922970104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"The Recycled Bottle Christmas Tree ","author":"Linda"}
