After ridding crops of plant lice and scale insects, the Halloween lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis) invades homes in October where it prepares for its well deserved hibernation. Before that long period of inactivity, it likes to stretch its wings a bit. That’s probably an understatement – wing acrobatics is more like it.\nLady bugs or ladybirds belong to the \n family of beetles and the Halloween lady beetle, at around 7-8 mm, is one of the larger lady bug varieties. It is a native of eastern Asia and was already introduced in North America in 1916 and in Europe in 2001 as an environmentally friendly way of dealing with crop pests, especially aphids a.k.a. plant lice. Because of the lady bug’s tendency to overwinter indoors, it is considered a nuisance by some but it shouldn’t be forgotten that in many countries, visiting ladybirds are considered good luck. That their spots indicate their age is a myth however.\nDid you miss the first sequence of acrobatics? Well, here’s another one, this time by the \n or two-spot ladybird:\nJust looking at these tiny acrobats makes one smile – even skeptics not believing in the good luck myth have to admit that temporary happiness is not to be discredited.\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/lizardjpg","title":"The Lady Bug Gymnastics","author":"Simone Preuss"}
