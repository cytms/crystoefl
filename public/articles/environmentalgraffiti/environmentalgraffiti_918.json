Three Italian men were arrested in the case, and have been charged with forcing the girls to live as virtual slaves-- paying them  100 euros each week and forcing them to live in an animal transport trailer.\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb39.webshots.com-37542-2113261470104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Pirahnas Attack Sideshow Bob","author":"whatsrequired"}
