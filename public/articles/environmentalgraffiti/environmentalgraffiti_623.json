As  the caterpillars keep munching away the newly grown leaves, the tree doesn't get its usual signal 'Leaves are Grown' yet – it just keeps growing new leaves while the caterpillars feast away.\n and they stop feeding. \nIt does that until finally, the signal arrives: 'Leaves are Grown'. Now it can get on with its summertime tree business – no harm done.\nOkay, now the caterpillars are full-sized, ready to pupate and morph into moths. \n, each individual seeking a quiet, protected place to spin its cocoon. \nAnd they seem to get their little caterpillar selves into all kinds of trouble! On screens, on porches, even inside houses. \n Or so it seems.\nSo how do you get rid of these home invaders? I'm glad you asked!\n You could cut the branch tips out and burn them – but this often requires more tree-climbing ability than most people possess. Better by far just to leave the tents be. \n Here's where you can most likely make a difference.\n\n•\tKeep a spritz bottle full of water and (are you ready for this?) dish soap. Douse each caterpillar you see outdoors, soak it good with the soapy water.\n\n•\tOr, even more effective, you could grab a pair of tweezers and seize each caterpillar (use tweezers since the hairs can be irritating to sensitive skin) and plunk it into a jar of... that's right, soapy water. \n how to handle the annual invasion of the Eastern Tent Caterpillars.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb01.webshots.com-30272-2957684240104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"How to Live With Eastern Tent Caterpillars","author":"dorothydot"}
