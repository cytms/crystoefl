The ban went into effect after a report was published in 2008 stating the species was overfished.\nBoat operators and commercial fisherman aren't too happy about it because they say they have to throw back the red snapper they catch, yet they don't then have any fish to take for the time they spent catching them.\nThe \n wants to ban fishing of even more snapper species, and fish that are accidentally caught alongside red snapper.\nSome fisherman say the ban is hurting their business. Research says there may not be enough fish left to sustainably catch. Because of this there is considerable friction on the subject of how many fish are left and how many can be caught. If all snapper stocks are depleted though, and with the Gulf oil disaster likely to have a negative impact on fish around the Florida coastline, anything that helps the fish is probably going to be for the best.\n\nAdditionally, Congress is considering a jobs creation act to help the fishermen who have seen their incomes fall as the snappers' numbers have been depleted. \nThere are even some areas where the ban may be repealed on the Eastern US seaboard, because reportedly \n of the red snapper population still lives there.\nUlimtaely, short-term thinking just isn't going to cut it.
