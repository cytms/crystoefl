And last night he humped your leg.\nMollydog goes outside to pee and eats her own poo.\nWorst of all, Duke bites the pizza-delivery boy hard enough to require sutures to close the wounds.

Your dog's like a little sponge, happily absorbing all your leftover love.\nIt's easy to forget your pet isn't a \"little people\". \nLoving? Sure. Cuddly? Yep. Always there when you need comfort? You bet.\nBut dogs they remain. Each one has dog needs, dog instincts, dog communication techniques.\nRolling in smelly, icky gunk = \"I need to hide my scent so my prey won't smell me coming.\"\nJumping up on people = \"I am soooo glad to see you. Let's play!\"\nMounting or humping = \"I really get stimulated when you're around.\"\nEating poop = \"I want this out of my habitat; besides, maybe there's some leftover nourishment here.\"\n hard enough to draw blood = \"I cannot control my impulse and instinct to defend.\" This is an animal that needs to be re-evaluated very carefully.
