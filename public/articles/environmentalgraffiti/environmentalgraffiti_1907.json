He is politely inviting visitors to instead *Play the Building*.\nInstead of using wind forced through pipes, each of the organâ€™s keys are connected by a multitude of tubes, pipes and wires to every conceivable facet of the building. Playing the organ causes various devices to hammer on water pipes, vibrate motors against the ceiling girders, magnetically beat against the building's roof columns or blow air through pipes. The 99 year old previously disused space is converted into a cast-iron orchestra, conducted by Byrne or any other person who wishes to play.\nThis site-specific installation, which was previously installed in Sweden, reflects the orchestral cacophony of the streets of New   York. It is one of a number of pieces concerned with the overlooked aspects of the city space, including the Turner Prize winning British artist and now Camera d'Or winning director Steve Mcqueen, who rolled a reclaimed oil barrel through 14 blocks of upper Manhattan, recording video and sound throughout his journey.\nThe building can be played until August 10th but as Byrne has said, \"Nobody is going to be able to play Bach on it.\"\n\n\n ","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb14.webshots.com-42317-2399964170104178106S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Huge Warehouse Can Be Played Like an Organ","author":"Chris"}
