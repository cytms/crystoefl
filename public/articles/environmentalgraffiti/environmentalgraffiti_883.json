It is huge, weighing in at half a ton.\nThe mysterious \"colossal squid,\" (the larger cousin of the giant squid), was caught last year by fishermen, who were obviously quite shocked to see such a beast in their nets.\nThis specimen, at 26 feet long and 1089 pounds, is a far cry from what scientists project to be a full size for the species-- over 15m long.\nThe researchers, are planning to remove the beak, stomach, and sex of the animal before putting it on display in a tank of formaldehyde. Scientists are excited about the possibility of having found the fist-ever male of the species, and the largest colossal squid to have been examined to date.\nLast year they were able to dissect a 660-pound female, the first foray into this rare species' biology. The entire operation-- thawing and dissecting the beast live-- is available \n.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/giantsquidphotofishingphotography3jpg_0","title":"1,000 Pound \"Colossal\" Squid Thawed in NZ","author":"whatsrequired"}
