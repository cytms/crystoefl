Malta is an important stopping point for many birds making their way from Africa to Europe in the spring to begin the mating season. Various conservation groups have applauded the EU’s action, and called Malta’s spring hunting and trapping season a serious \n.\nThe specific legal issue involves the EU Birds directive.  The directive bans the trapping or hunting of several species, including the common quail and European turtle dove, during the Spring migration period. Malta has ignored these laws, exacerbating \n, since it joined the EU four years ago.\nThe European Commission started legal proceedings over the matter in 2006 and at the end of last year gave the island a final caution, a Reasoned Opinion saying the island should end spring hunting permanently and immediately. As the government has not responded, the case will go to the European Court of Justice.\nOver 100,000 birds are shot by hunters in Malta every year, amazing numbers for islands with only 400,000 inhabitants.

An international uproar led the Maltese government to close the Spring hunting season early, but the government did not make any permanent changes to prevent such hunts in the future.\nMalta has a long tradition of bird hunting on the island, but I can’t imagine they will continue to allow hunting during the migration season much longer.
