When they go to the doorstep they’ve found extra bottles intricately decorated with cows, sheep or mice. For months, residents have been trying to figure out who their secret deliveries are from… has the infamous graffiti artist, Banksy decided to target milk bottles instead of walls? Was the great graffiti King getting bored?\nA resident in the West Midlands town of Stourbridge, in the UK, discovered one of the bottles outside her house on Monday. She spoke to the Daily Mail:\n\n\nAnother resident said her son had been trying to get up really early to catch the artist at it. “But it's like Santa – you never see them.”\nNow the secret's out. The milk bottle artist, and ex-lecturer, has been revealed to be Charlotte Hughes-Martin, a 30-year-old artist from the area. Motivated by a desire to show how ‘domestic, everyday objects can be things of beauty too’, she has happily been delivering the alternative milk bottles for months.\n\n\n\nWe wonder does she do requests. Can we have manta ray please?\nSource: ","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/IA1jpg","title":"Milk Bottle Artist Does a Banksy","author":"Linda"}
