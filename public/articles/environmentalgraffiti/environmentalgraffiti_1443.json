Hiking up Mt Hua and exploring the surrounding area is a popular attraction as there are many temples and religious sights located throughout the area. Some of the most amazing sights, however, are at the top of the mountain.\nThere are safe, more tourist friendly paths up the mountain but for those looking for a truly awe inspiring experience there are also more dangerous routes, such as this one. It includes sections which are nothing but scant three boards hugging the mountainside and a massive vertical drop only a step away.\nIt has been reported that as many as 100 people per year have died on the trail in the past, though how the trail could remain open with such a high mortality rate makes the claim somewhat skeptical. The trail is anything but safe, however. There are many sections where the only footholds are those that have been drilled in to the mountain, and other places where chains bolted to the mountain are the only handholds that protect against a very long fall.\n\n\nIn spite of the danger though, people continue to visit the remote mountain in droves. In the middle of winter, with even the safe tourist path covered in ice and snow, people continue to climb the mountain and take in the beautiful sights that the peak provides.\nSource \n, ","web_category":"outdoor","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/summit-mushroomjpg","title":"Earth's Deadliest Hiking Trail","author":"Stuart"}
