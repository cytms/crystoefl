The photographer had seen the cat and mouse face off with each other a twice before this image was captured. Flickr user \n was sitting on the grass, camera in hand, ready to shoot, just in case it happened again. This image is the result. Check out the expression on the mouse’s face. It’s as if it’s been captured mid-sentence.

Feel free to drop your thoughts in the comments section below.\n\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded.jpg","title":"\"Er, Buddy, Could We Not Talk About This?\" [PIC]","author":"Linda"}
