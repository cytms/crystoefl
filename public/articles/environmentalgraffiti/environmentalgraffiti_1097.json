The number of young fish has increased though, and the report calls for a 50% reduction of 2006 fishing numbers rather than a complete ban. \nThe report attributes the increase in the number of young fish to a decrease in fishing pressures as a result of government constraints on fishing levels.\nIt warns that unless restraints on the number of fish collected and illegal catches are continued, the fish population may start dropping again.\nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Nile-perch.jpg","title":"Great Cod Almighty","author":"Chris"}
