Most of the islands in the country are no higher than one meter above sea level. \nAt a development and climate change conference in Lisbon, Gayoom said: \"Never in our documented history have so many islands been affected to such an extent. These surges were a grim reminder of the devastating tsunami of 2004 and a clear warning of future disasters.”\nIf the UN IPCC estimate that sea levels will rise between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 is correct, 80% of the Maldives will be partially submerged by the end of the century.  Gayoom urged countries to act even if they are not directly effected at the moment, saying: \"Unless climate change is addressed quickly and effectively your fate could be similar.\"\nThe UN estimates that 50 million people will become environmental refugees, people fleeing their homeland due to environmental conditions, by the end of the decade.\nSource: ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Beachchoronivenezuelajpg","title":"Paradise Islands On Climate Change Hit List","author":"Chris"}
