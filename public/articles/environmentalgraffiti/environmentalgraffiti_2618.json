But this weekend, we've got an opportunity to get both of us out of the house for a bit, and learn quite a bit about sustainable development--we hope you'll join us at London Aware 08.\nWe'll be at the Barbican Centre in London; a venue chosen for the affair because of their wonderful policies on sustainability and recycling. To say that this is going to be a good conference (we know - contradiction in terms) is an understatement: there will be 75 industry-leading exhibitors, world class speakers on \"greening\" every aspect of your life as well as climate change, guest author appearances, and a special award presented to a student for eco-innovation. After all students are the ones that have to deal with the mess we're leaving them.\nIn the words of conference orgainser Danny /Chris' \n \n drinking buddy/, \"come along, it's fucking great!\"\n[\n]","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb24.webshots.com-44055-2359028470104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Join Environmental Graffiti At London Aware 08","author":"whatsrequired"}
