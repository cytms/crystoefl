Underneath the huge mass of water, right on sea floor, lurk creatures that have never seen before by human eyes. That is because only 1% of our ocean floor has been explored. It is still one of the greatest mysteries of our times.\nJust recently, an expedition led by Monty Priede, director of the Oceanlab research center at the University of Aberdeen returned successful. “We found lots of these primitive species,\" said Priede \"It was like going to a new country.\" Indeed, it is a bizarre world, 11,500 feet beneath the sea. It is filled with exotic worms, beautiful coral, transparent fish and yet it is completely in the dark.\nThe team of 31 scientists, coordinated by the Norway-based MAR-ECO project and the global Census of Marine Life program initiative, were the first to see a huge range of marine species, due to the depths and pressures that the ocean yields.
