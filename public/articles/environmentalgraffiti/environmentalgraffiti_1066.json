The WWF is asking for a closure of at least 3 years.  \nDr Sergi Tudela, Head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean, said: “A healthy Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery for the future demands management measures based on scientific advice and strict enforcement. But if fishing levels continue at the present rate there will simply be no tuna left to catch.”\nThe Mediterranean bluefin tuna is a highly prized food species. It is a particular delicacy in Japan where it is used in sushi.  However, the fish has been under pressure from overfishing for an extended period of time.  \nDr. Tudela said: “This year ICCAT has a unique opportunity to give this majestic species a fighting chance of survival. The choice is simple: moratorium today for a sustainable fishery tomorrow, or do nothing and fish this princely species to an untimely death.”","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb28.webshots.com-43675-2686175750102347975S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"WWF Calls for End to Tuna Fishing in the Med","author":"Chris"}
