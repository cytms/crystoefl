{"url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/recycled-newspaper-designs/2748","content":"\nAn ambitious French furniture designer has taken an unusual approach to using recycled materials in his work, and with great effect.\n, a young designer studying at London’s Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, has fashioned a way to use some of the thousands of free newspapers that litter the capital’s streets. His new series, called ‘X day projects’, aims to create furniture from the mound of discarded papers without using other materials to stick them together, such as screws, nails, or glue.\nThe first of the series to be released is the logically named '334', after the number of newspapers used in its creation. Shown above, it took only three pieces of metal to give the bench its shape and enough strength to support five people. And what’s more, the designer claims it only cost him about £5 to make. Bonus.\nFor price, simplicity and novelty factor, Oscar’s creation seems well worth the money. Just remember to keep it out of the rain!\nSource: ","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/airplane-hotel-1.jpg","title":"The Recycled Newspaper Bench","author":"katherineliew"}
