This smiley creature was snapped in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. A member of the giant clam family \n, the bivalve mollusc can reach up to 1.2 meters across and 200 kgs (440 lbs) and if left to flourish can live up to 100 years. This great shot captures an unusual, almost human-like grin – most clams have undulating lips so these straight lips are extraordinary. \nWe hope you’re enjoyed all the images and articles of the various environmental curiosities we've published over the past year. We wouldn’t be anything without our readers though, so would like to thank each and every one of you for logging on and spending time on the site.\nAll is left for us to say now, is \n See you in 2009!\nThe Environmental Graffiti team x\n\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb47.webshots.com-44910-2851015150104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Giant Clam Says Happy New Year!","author":"Linda"}
