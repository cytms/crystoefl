The growing demand for ethanol vis a vis King Corn is driving more and more farmers to plant more and more corn.\nThe problem is that the nitrogen-heavy fertilizers used to grow that much more corn are finding their way down the Mississippi River and into the Gulf of Mexico.  It is here that the nitrogen chokes the aquatic life by fostering algae blooms.  The algae then dies and sinks, sucking up oxygen in order to decompose.  With less oxygen in the water, many species are dying or moving further and further out into the Gulf.\nAs reported by the Associated Press:\n\n\nSo yes, biofuels are great and all, but as with most \"quick fixes\" that the US seems to love, there is a downside.  And this is happening in a part of the US that has more than enough problems already.  The Gulf of Mexico States' economies depend on the \"harvest\" from the Gulf, much as the Corn Belt States depend on the corn harvest. Again from the AP.\n\n\nAnd really, this news is not new.  The Gulf Deadzone was first noticed in 1985.  But it seems that things are just getting worse lately.  This is from a 2005 article on \n.\n\n\nand\n\n\nThe 2007 corn season saw the most corn planted since 1944, so it will be interesting, and not to mention scary, to see how the Gulf is affected this winter.\nBy new contributor Rachael Neile-Mcgrew.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Walross_2002.jpg","title":"More Corn=Less Fish","author":"ecotraz"}
