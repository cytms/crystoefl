If you are lucky enough to have your own garden, make the most of it and show it some love. It will give you back so much in return. A lush lawn, pruned hedges and tidy foliage and a rainbow of sprouting bulbs make a garden look pretty and welcoming, and maintaining it to this standard takes minimal effort, really – you just need to push a lawnmower around once a month, pull up a few weeds and get acquainted with your power strimmer. If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, add a water feature or some border plants with some herbaceous sproutings here and there. Gnomes and decorative birdhouses are always optional. If you’re feeling middle-aged, recline in a comfy chair with a cup of tea and listen to Gardener’s Question Time for some hints and tips all year round. Water regularly, especially during the spring and summer. \nOf course, not everyone with a garden is blessed with green fingers, or even the time or inclination to find out if they have green fingers. But even if you’re too young to remember classic heart-warming English sitcom The Good Life, you’re never too young or old – or too busy – to start making a good life for yourself and your family. This starts with good, healthy living, and that doesn’t have to mean relying on your local supermarket for all your fresh produce. A well-tended garden with a cherished vegetable patch can yield crops of all your kitchen cupboard staples: apples, potatoes, tomatoes, lettuces, courgettes, carrots, all kinds of berries – and all certified organic, because you know exactly where they came from and even get to pick them yourself!\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Baby5_1.jpg","title":"Gardening Tips To Help You Go Green ","author":"darconvillescat"}
