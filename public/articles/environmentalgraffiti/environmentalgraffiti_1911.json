How did that happen? If you're GM, second-largest manufacturer in the world, it's with dead bodies\nGM is for obvious reasons, being rather tight-lipped on the issue. The Swedish government, which oversaw the experiment, would only say that the bodies were essential to \"certain things\" and that the cadavers had been donated to science by the deceased. The project length was unknown. However, a multiyear effort involving at least ten corpses crashed in GM automobiles was carried out. GM is reportedly making all of the data they gather available to all of their brands and partners. Unsurprisingly, they also declined to comment.\n[\n]","web_category":"art+and+design","advice_category":"6","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Planecrashcity.jpg","title":"Real Cadavers Used as Crash Test Dummies","author":"whatsrequired"}
