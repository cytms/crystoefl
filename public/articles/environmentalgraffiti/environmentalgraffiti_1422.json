If the bungee jump, parachuting or white water rafting are the things that get your juices flowing, then you have to be an instant fan of airkicking.\nThis isn't the tame stuff of martial arts but the invention of German daredevil and stuntman Jochen Schwiezer. The AirKick is without doubt one of the most enjoyable toys you could ever wish to have by your pool.  If you get your hands on one, all your friends will want to know.\nThe AirKick is a catapult which launches individuals over 26 feet in the air into a swimming pool or foam pit. Describing the machine Jochen explains:\n“It propels the rider through the air in a pre-calculated parabolic trajectory using a special combination of air pressure and water recoil technology. The rider sits in a specially constructed seat at the back end of the catapult arm, which is about 4mtrs long, and sets the device in motion himself by pushing a button.\"\nContinues Jochen: \"Approximately 60 liters of water are then forced through a rocket nozzle under the seat. This pressurized water (8 to 10 bar of air pressure) propels the participant 8 meters though the air for a cool and refreshing splash down in a swimming pool.”\nWatch the video \n for a clearer picture of what this wonderful machine can do to help you have a real fun time.  It is no rocket science but a rocket catapult that will hurl you time after time. Extreme fun for a warm day.
