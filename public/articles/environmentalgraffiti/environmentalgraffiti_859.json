At the side of the road he undid his pants and crouched down. \nOnly moments later, a venomous brown snake had slithered through his legs and bitten his “Prince Albert.”\nThe tourist miraculously survived, as an ambulance spokesman elegantly explained ‘It certainly had a swipe at him, but it didn't envenomate him.’ He was treated at the scene by having his penis wrapped in plastic. It was later confirmed that no poison had spread.\nHe did however receive a savage gouging to his gonads and tip, and a heavy combo of multiple vomiting and stomach pains. After recovering at the hospital he quotes with hindsight “I’m a bit shocked and embarrassed but I’m lucky.’\n(Obviously he was referring to his life, not his manhood).\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb31.webshots.com-41374-2333990670104237032S500x500Q85.jpg","title":"Snake Attacks Man's Penis","author":"alex ingham"}
