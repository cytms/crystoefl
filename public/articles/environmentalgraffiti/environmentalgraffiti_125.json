(Well, that may have been his intention...) The whole idea came from one of the Trust's mammal keepers, John Stark.\n“The animals here at the wildlife park regularly receive enrichment treats which encourage them to forage for food much as they would in the wild and help to keep them mentally stimulated. In an attempt to get really up close and personal we decided to install a HD camera in Ya Kwanza's daily enrichment device!” said Stark. \nSource: ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded.jpg","title":"Self-Portraits Snapped by a Silverback Gorilla","author":"Michele Collet"}
