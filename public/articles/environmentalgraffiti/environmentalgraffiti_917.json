Prosthetic limbs have long fostered issues with the rubbing and chafing of a hard surface against soft flesh, which can become a serious medical problem if it is allowed to proceed unchecked.  The squid has been able to avoid this, and so with luck will the next generation of soldiers and trauma victims.\n ","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/giantsquidphotofishingphotography3jpg_0","title":"Squid Beaks Make Awesome Prosthetic Limbs","author":"whatsrequired"}
