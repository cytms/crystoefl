In Latin it stands for \"cruel or harsh\" I think the \n best describes how she gets the blues and reds in her eyes: \"I have noticed that the eyes of female Maevia inclemens are often \n vivid. With their beautiful deep blue anterior median eyes displaying the occasional moving wash of red due to the internal movement of the spider's retina, they are truly remarkable.\"\nMale and female jumping spiders are often very different in appearance, and their extraordinary coloration feeds into their ritual courtship displays. Bizarre features may include colored or iridescent hairs, plumose hairs and front leg fringes. \nWhen the spiders are courting, they will put their colored or iridescent parts on display, engaging in vibrational, zigzagging or sideling movements as part of a courtship dance. \nTo show approval the female will crouch, awaiting the male, or in some species may vibrate her palps or abdomen. The male will then extend his front legs and climb onto the females back, before inseminating her with his palps.\nThere are so many of these beauties it is hard to choose which ones to display!\nJuvenile Phidippus putnami: (pictured as an adult at top)\nThanks to the marvelous photographer Thomas Shahan who gave me permission to use his images from his collection on Flickr and on his website \n, where he has much more than jumping spiders on display.","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb43.webshots.com-42410-2825839170104237032S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Staring into the Jeweled Eyes of the Jumping Spider","author":"Michele Collet"}
