Only this time she’s a true miniature mare.\nLucy is owned by veterinary surgeon Sandra Power, who is unclear why the pony didn’t grow much bigger – she stopped growing when she reached the age of two. \nMs Power told the \nnewspaper: \"I wasn't expecting Lucy to be so small. She was about 15 inches when I got her at three months – that's a normal size for a Shetland foal.” \nAccording to her owner, Lucy is perfectly proportioned, apart from her mane and tail, which grow at an alarming rate.\nLucy lives in custom-made stables with a door that is only 21 inches high – something that would put a kid’s Wendy house to shame.\nSource \n, \n\n","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb51.webshots.com-45618-2053121030105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Thumbelina and Lucy: The World's Smallest Horses","author":"Linda"}
