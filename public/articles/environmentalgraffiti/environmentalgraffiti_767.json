The rest of us are left gazing at the present, which often reveals itself in most mysterious ways. One drop of rain, for example, can capture our world like a tiny crystal ball. Or for some, the following pictures may be reminders of the snow domes of childhood. Only that these cannot be shaken, only rotated.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nRaindrops, crystal balls and the world seen through them have inspired artists for centuries. Dutch graphic artist MC Escher’s works “Hand with Reflecting Sphere” (1935), “Three Spheres II” (1946) and “Dewdrop” (1948), for example, surely remind one of some of the images here.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nThose who know Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte’s painting “Golconda” (1953), in which tiny men in suits and bowler hats seem to rain from the sky, will enjoy the next photograph.\n\nImage: \nSo the next time you get caught in a spring shower, watch for the beauty it brings along. This leaves us to end with the words of someone who brought beauty to the world, with his words:\n“I to the world am like a drop of water\n\nThat in the ocean seeks another drop,\n\nWho, falling there to find his fellow forth,\n\nUnseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.”\n-- William Shakespeare\n(Found accompanying Flickr user Spisharam’s excellent photograph.)","web_category":"nature","advice_category":"2","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/early-snack_0.jpg","title":"Captured in Morning Dew","author":"Simone Preuss"}
