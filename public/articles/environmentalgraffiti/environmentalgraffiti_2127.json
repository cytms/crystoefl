In the forest maybe, in a church or through cloud cover over the sea? Called crepuscular rays, these columns of sunlit air streaming through gaps in clouds, branches or buildings create stunning displays of light and shadow. We’ve found 20 images that absolutely took our breath away.\n\nImage: \nApart from a source throwing a shadow, crepuscular rays need the aid of particles to reflect off to be visible, for example dust particles, snow, fog or water droplets.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nThe hours around dusk and dawn are called the crepuscular hours (literally: relating to twilight) and have given this light phenomenon its name. Dusk and dawn is the time of the rays’ most frequent occurrences when the contrast between light and dark is the most obvious.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nCrepuscular rays actually do not radiate from one point but are near parallel. Similar to railway tracks disappearing into the distance, they seem to diverge because of the distance and perspective they are viewed at.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nThey occur when objects such as mountain peaks, clouds, trees or tall buildings partially shadow the sun's rays and separate sunlit areas and darker, cloud-shaded ones.\n\nImage: \nThe phenomenon has been observed by the earliest human settlers and all over the world – reason why the ancient Greeks incorporated an image of “the sun drawing water” into their belief system as much as the Maori had a tale of the “ropes of Maui”.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nArchitects of churches, temples and other religious buildings knew how to use the crepuscular ray effect most effectively.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nCrepuscular rays are colloquially known as a Jacob’s Ladder, Gateways to Heaven, Buddha’s Fingers, Jesus Beams, God’s Rays, sunbeams, cloud breaks and many other names. It is not surprising that many of the names have religious connotations as crepuscular rays seem to be a message from the gods. The next image, for example, could be taken straight from a religious treaty:\n\nImage: \nPale, pinkish or reddish crepuscular rays that seem to radiate from below the horizon are often mistaken for \n, a phenomenon we have described earlier here on EG.\n\nImage: \n\nImage: \n\nImage: \nThe last pic should clear up any questions about sunbeams or crepuscular rays: sunlight + obstruction + scattering object = crepuscular rays. Simple yet effective.\n\nImage: \n","web_category":"science","advice_category":"4","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb27.webshots.com-14490-2300872820102347975S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"20 Incredible Crepuscular Rays","author":"Simone Preuss"}
