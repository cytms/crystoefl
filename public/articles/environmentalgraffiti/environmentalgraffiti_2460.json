But does the process of baking bananas deplete their nutritional value? Are there any banana bread recipes for diabetics?\nBananas are well known to be a good source of potassium and carry several other vitamins and minerals with only 105 calories per banana. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, because no single food item can do everything.\nThe bad news is that a slice of banana bread has less than a fifth of the potassium of a single banana, one quarter the magnesium, far more sodium, adds fat and doubles the calories.
