While some of the money from carbon credits is earmarked for environmental projects, significant portions are dealt out to investors, administrators, and project insurers who, let’s face it, are not guided by the same moral compass as those who purchase offsets.\nThis practice of self-soothing our own environmental conscience actually does little to help offset our emissions. It is not the best solution; it’s the easiest one. The most effective alternatives to offsetting — activism, community involvement, changing the way we live individually and as a society — require more involvement than simply opening a wallet.\n","web_category":"lifestyle","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb24.webshots.com-44055-2359028470104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Green Guilt: Soothing Society's Conscience with Offsetting","author":"TheJohn"}
