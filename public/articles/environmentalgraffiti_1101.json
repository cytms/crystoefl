When the signals turn negative they stop.\"\n \nDroughts cause a competition for scarce resources, so when times start to get tough, kangaroos compete with sheep and cattle for food and water, Mackey said.\n \n\"Because Australia naturally has a boom and bust environment, you have large droughts and flooding rains. From year to year rainfall is quite unreliable. In order for an animal to live in this environment they have to have a strategy to survive,\" Mackey said. \nKangaroos are impacting endangered ecological communities, which include several threatened species, and there are strong indications that many kangaroos will soon starve unless numbers there are reduced,'' said Russell Watkinson, the director of Australia's Parks, Conservation and Lands.\nSo what will the outcome be? Will the kangaroo\u2019s attack the humans? Not likely. What is more likely to happen is that kangaroos will drain the food supply, creating a mass famine, not only for their species, but also other ecosystems.\n ","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Huge Swarm of Bouncing Kangaroos invade Australia\u2019s Cities.
