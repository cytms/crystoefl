The environmental footprint was measured by the area of land and ocean required to feed, make energy, produce resources, and absorb the waste and pollution produced by residents. \nThe WWF commissioned the report to show the ways in which British residents are living unsustainably, and to show ways to change their lifestyles.  The results were particularly depressing as even the lowest-ranked city consumed far more resources than necessary.  If all humans had the same rate of consumption and carbon emissions as the UK, three planets would be required to support the population.\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Winchester: UK's Dirtiest City ","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb24.webshots.com-44055-2359028470104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/winchester-uks-dirtiest-city/361"}
