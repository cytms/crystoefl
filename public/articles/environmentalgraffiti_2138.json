He seemed sincere--using the moment to discuss gay rights-- but the Daily Mirror is asking if this is all a hoax.\nImage from ariffjrs on Flickr\nOf course, nobody is disputing the essential facts of the case-- that Thomas Lagondino, born Tracy, retained his childbearing capacity after undergoing a series of operations to bring his physical condition in line with his mental reality-- but Fox News, arbiter of balance and truth, has let its gaze linger on the day a confidentiality clause ends:  tomorrow, April first.\nWhile I certainly have to doubt Fox's intentions-- are they only paying attention to this so they don't have to report about the increased violence in Iraq? Are they happy to bring doubt upon someone who has openly advocated for gay marriage?  The surge is working, America!--that is a remarkable coincidence, especially considering that Oprah is rumored to have made a seven-figure offer for exclusive interview rights with the couple (Thomas is married).\nFor what it's worth, a neighbor close to the situation, as well as the gay magazine The Advocate, both confirm that the baby is very real.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
