Some whistle when you pass by, some move when you give them money. Some do it as a career, others between jobs. But whatever the case, being a living statue takes guts, strength, creativity and yes, a good deal of exhibitionism.   \nPhoto: Image: Adrian Pingstone\nLiving statues can be seen all around the world, but have a long history, especially in the European street theatre tradition. More than merely standing around, they perform according to their own script. Many street artists painstakingly design their costumes and put a lot of thought into their performances.  \nPhoto: Image: Christian Bickel\nIn the 15th April 2008 Metro.co.uk article, \u201cWhy Being a Living Statue Isn\u2019t Easy\u201d, one female professional street performer says: \nThere are even professional companies who employ living statues and rent them out for trade shows, parties and promotional events, no doubt charging a bomb. \nEven the communist party has been caught on camera, promoting their agenda with two living hammer-and-sickle statues at a rally at Cochin Fort in Kerala, India.

He has been a living statue since 1987, starting off performing at Las Ramblas in Barcelona but now to be found all over Europe. Since then, he has surpassed his own record by standing still for 20 hours, 11 minutes and 38 seconds in 2003. Wonder what he does if he has sneeze \u2013 or pee. \nStaticman at the Living Statues Festival 2008 in Espinho, Portugal.Photo: Image: Staticman\nLiving statues are a well loved part of festivals, but they have their own events too, dedicated exclusively to their art, like the World Statues Festival that takes place every year in the Netherlands.    \nPhoto: Image: Frank Vincentz\nHere are some more pictures of living statues that might inspire you.
