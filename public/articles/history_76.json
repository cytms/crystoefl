For more than 20 years during the so-called Time of Troubles, the country had suffered a devastating series of invasions, famines and revolts while a string of would-be leaders tried to fill the void left by the Rurik dynasty\u2019s extinction. No less than three different pretenders to the throne, known collectively as the \u201cFalse Dmitrys,\u201d all claimed to be the long-dead younger son of Ivan the Terrible. A national assembly was convened to review dozens of possible candidates, and on February 21, 1613, Michael, a relative of one of Ivan the Terrible\u2019s wives, was declared czar.\nThe 16-year-old noble wasn\u2019t exactly eager to accept his new role. His parents had suffered greatly during the Time of Troubles\u2014his mother had been forced to become a nun and his father a monk\u2014and he and his mother were in hiding when emissaries from the national convention arrived. Once he agreed to lead Russia, the uneducated and physically weak Michael wasn\u2019t exactly a strong-willed ruler, but his legitimate presence brought both peace and order to a country on the verge of destruction.\nThe illegitimate daughter of Peter the Great and a mistress who later became his wife, Elizabeth traveled down a rocky path to the throne. Sixteen years after her father\u2019s death, she engineered a coup against the sitting regent, Anna Leopoldovna, and later wrested control of Russia\u2019s bureaucracy from German courtiers. Fun-loving and flirtatious, Elizabeth was the life of the party at the Russian court and took dozens of lovers\u2014but behind this fa?ade was a will of steel.\nElizabeth abolished the death penalty, opened some of Russia\u2019s first universities and supported the Russian Orthodox Church. She became Russia\u2019s premier patron of the arts, and many of the country\u2019s architectural glories were built and designed during her reign. Though she achieved military and diplomatic success in the Seven Years\u2019 War, these achievements were quickly undone by her nephew and heir Peter III, who after a brief reign was overthrown by his wife Catherine II\u2014now known to history as Catherine the Great.\nCatherine the Great\u2019s beloved grandson came to power after the assassination of his father Paul I, a crime he more than likely knew about before it happened. The events that handed him the throne would haunt Alexander I for the rest of his life. Among non-Russians, this idealistic czar\u2014whose reign provided the backdrop for Tolstoy\u2019s epic \u201cWar and Peace\u201d\u2014is perhaps best remembered for his complex relationship with Napoleon Bonaparte. As a young man, Alexander greatly admired the dynamic French leader, but their relationship soon soured. By 1812 Napoleon\u2019s massive continental army was poised to invade Russia. In what many consider his finest hour, Alexander rallied his people to the defense of the motherland and, with the fortuitous help of the brutal Russian winter, turned back Napoleon\u2019s army before it reached Moscow. The czar then took his troops on a ridiculously long victory march across Europe and arrived in Paris just in time to take part in the 1814 Treaty of Paris, which put Russia at the political center of Europe.\nOn the home front, Alexander had a far more complicated record. A reformer in the early part of his reign, he soon realized (like other leaders before and after him) that governing the unruly Russian empire was far easier to do with a strong fist. He began to renege on many of his more liberal policies and increasingly withdrew from public life until his death in November 1825. Even in death, the czar proved an enigma: Rumors swirled that he had faked his demise, secretly abdicated and scurried off to live the life of a religious hermit. To this day, many people claim that one of the Orthodox Church\u2019s most famous saints was actually Alexander. This belief was strengthened when Soviet officials opened his grave in the early 20th century and\u2014supposedly, at least\u2014found an empty casket.\nThe ninth child and third son of Paul I, Nicholas I was an unlikely ruler. He had spent his early years in the army, where his cruel, ruthless nature earned him few admirers and many enemies. Alexander I\u2019s sudden and mysterious death in late 1825 left Russia with a succession crisis: Grand Duke Constantine, the heir apparent, had the backing of Russia\u2019s powerful military but little inclination to take on the job, while Nicholas had few supporters. Tensions came to a head in December when a group of army cadets rose up in armed protest against Nicholas\u2019 accession. The new czar brutally crushed the rebellion, known as the Decembrist Revolt, executing many of its leaders and sentencing the rest to the horrors of a Siberian exile.\nThings went downhill from there. Nicholas spent the next 30 years rooting out \u201cdissent\u201d wherever he could find it\u2014in the military, in universities, in government and even in the arts. (He had a famously antagonistic relationship with the celebrated poet\u2014and supporter of liberal reforms\u2014Alexander Pushkin.) A secret police force helped him enforce his slogan of \u201cautocracy, Orthodoxy and nationality,\u201d which stressed traditional Russian culture, values and religion at the expense of those perceived as outsiders. Though a strong supporter of the army, Nicholas had mixed results as a military leader. He successfully expanded the Russian empire to more than 7 million square miles, making it the largest it would ever be. But his 1853 attempt to create a Russian Orthodox presence in the Muslim Ottoman Empire led to the Crimean War, a disastrous, demoralizing defeat that highlighted how weak Russia had become under the czar\u2019s reactionary regime.\nIt\u2019s an odd quirk of history that a czar as conservative as Nicholas I would have a son so open to reform that he was nicknamed \u201cthe Liberator.\u201d Far more educated, worldly and prepared for the job than his father had been, Alexander II moved quickly to extract Russia from the deadly Crimean War before turning his attention to some of Nicholas\u2019 most destructive measures. He eased censorship of the press, liberalized the education system and instituted a series of legal reforms that granted an unprecedented amount of self-government to local communities. Aware that Russia lagged behind the more modern nations of Western Europe, Alexander completely restructured the country\u2019s economy. In 1861 he abolished serfdom, which had long held more than 20 million Russian peasants in bondage to their landowners. Their emancipation, Alexander argued, was not only morally just, but it was also economically beneficial to all classes. Russia also experienced an industrial revolution under Alexander II: Production boomed; the army was transformed into a military machine equipped with the latest weapons; and a train network crisscrossed the country, allowing for the exploitation of its vast natural resources.\nBut not everyone was a fan of Alexander\u2019s reforms. Some on the right worried that he was moving too far, too fast. The left, meanwhile, turned on the ruler when he passed a series of conservative measures, openly calling for the overthrow of the czarist system itself. Several failed assassination attempts followed before the Liberator was finally killed on March 13, 1881, by a bomb-throwing member of the group Narodnaya Volya, or People\u2019s Will. Ironically, on the day he died, Alexander had signaled his support for Russia\u2019s first-ever legislative assembly. Like Nicholas I before him, the newly crowned Alexander III abandoned his father\u2019s attempts at reform. Russia\u2019s harsh return to an increasingly autocratic system ushered in the 1917 Russian Revolution, which would see the end of the 300-year-old Romanov dynasty and the rise of the communist Soviet Union.","author":"Barbara  Maranzani","web_category":"news","title":"5 Romanovs You Should Know","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/romanovs-michael.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/5-romanovs-you-should-know"}
