And the best thing is, it's open to anyone. All you have to do is sign up and describe what you love best about our planet.\nPhoto: WWF\nAs Sir David Attenborough says in his contribution to Earth Book: \u201cThe miracle of nature is right there in front of you. A bud opening into a flower is an astonishment. And as you watch the workings of the natural world, you can\u2019t help wondering how you fit into it.\u201d\nSimply experiencing and enjoying nature is certainly one way of fitting in, recording special moments is another means of relating to it, and then of course there\u2019s conserving the natural world and its resources \u2013 which is obviously extremely important. After all, without nature, we\u2019re nothing; and future generations should be able to be in touch with and benefit from the joys of the natural world too.    \nPhoto: WWF\nWWF\u2019s Earth Book project is a great way to contribute by recording your own story: those interested simply have to write about an experience they\u2019ve had with nature and the planet, and perhaps upload an image or draw something that relates to their experience. But hurry \u2013 the project will only run until the Rio+20 Earth Summit, which starts on June 20th.\nPhoto: WWF\nAt the Earth Summit, the WWF will present its Living Planet Report, which \u201chighlights the tremendous pressure we are putting on our planet.\u201d Underlining the severity of the situation, the WWF adds: \u201cWe are using 50% more resources than the earth can provide and by 2025 even two planets will not be enough.\u201d\nA chilling thought!
