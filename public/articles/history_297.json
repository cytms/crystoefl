At least, that\u2019s what a remarkably detailed drawing of a ship, signed \u201cGeo. Washington\u201d and dated \u201cMarch 12th, 1742,\u201d might lead us to believe. Tom Lingenfelter, president of the Heritage Collectors\u2019 Society in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, announced his discovery of the postcard-sized sketch earlier this week and has presented evidence tying it to the founding father and war hero.\nLingenfelter said he bought the worn document for $500 at an auction 10 years ago, knowing full well its authenticity hadn\u2019t been verified; indeed, the seller, whose father had obtained the drawing around 1950, warned him it might be a forgery. \u201cI had some money in my pocket and nobody else wanted it,\u201d Lingenfelter shrugged. \u201cI thought the chances of it being genuine were slim, but the gambler in me bought it anyway.\u201d\nA lifetime collector who several years ago unveiled a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence, Lingenfelter had his new purchase analyzed by forensics experts. To his pleasant surprise, they dated the paper and ink to Washington\u2019s lifetime. \u201cI thought, well, now it\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Lingenfelter recalled.\nNext, Lingenfelter said, \u201cI started tracking down all these signatures and comparing his handwriting.\u201d He noticed similarities between the penmanship on the drawing and copy books held in the National Archives and dating from George\u2019s school days, when the teenager was trained in surveying and mapmaking. Although Washington\u2019s scrawl evolved over the years, the writing accompanying the illustration appeared consistent with its progression, Lingenfelter said.\nLike other observers, Lingenfelter was struck by the sketch\u2019s precise lines and artistic quality, demonstrating an astonishing level of proficiency for a 10-year-old boy. \u201cIt\u2019s so early and it\u2019s so good, I had the same reaction most people would have,\u201d he said. However, he continued, 18th-century children mastered skills and assumed adult roles while still very young. \u201cAt that age, it was pretty typical and expected,\u201d he said.\nWashington arguably grew up even faster than his peers, inheriting his boyhood home at 11 upon his father\u2019s death. Unable to attend school in England as his older half-brothers had done, he trained with various tutors and secured his first job as a public surveyor in 1749. \u201cHe was doing advanced math by the time he was 14,\u201d said Lingenfelter. \u201cAt 16 he was out being a full-fledged surveyor.\u201d After serving in the French and Indian War in his early 20s, Washington famously supplemented his patchy education with books and independent study; unlike many of his fellow founding fathers, who received college degrees, America\u2019s first commander-in-chief was largely self-taught.\nLingenfelter noted that the drawing\u2019s subject\u2014a two-masted sailboat\u2014also corresponds to what we know about Washington as a youngster. Growing up on the Rappahannock River across from Fredericksburg, Virginia, he regularly observed ferries and other vessels and developed a keen interest in seafaring. At 14 he sought to follow his brother Lawrence into the British Royal Navy, but his mother forbade George from entering a profession that would take him far from home.\nIf the document is indeed authentic, it could shed light on a hazy phase of Washington\u2019s biography that countless historians have struggled to decode. \u201cThere is nothing of George Washington in existence at that period in his life,\u201d Lingenfelter said. \u201cThis opens the door to what his education might have been like.\u201d For instance, it might suggest that Washington harbored an interest in his future trade and began learning how to draw several years earlier than confirmed manuscripts show.\nHistorian Edward Lengel, editor-in-chief of the University of Virginia\u2019s Papers of George Washington project, expressed the same sentiment. \u201cIf it\u2019s genuine, it\u2019s a very exciting discovery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be the earliest known George Washington document.\u201d Currently, the oldest papers linked to Washington date back to 1744, two years after the date on the drawing, Lengel said. They include a copy of an etiquette guide entitled \u201c\u2019Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation,\u201d painstakingly transcribed as part of a penmanship exercise.\nLengel agreed with Lingenfelter that the future founding father could have been capable of producing this type of work, even at a very young age. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of character for Washington,\u201d Lengel said. \u201cWe know from some of his teenage creations when he was a surveyor that he got a lot of pleasure out of making meticulous drawings. He had a mind like an engineer and could be very precise about these things.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it would ever be possible to prove that this was the work of George Washington,\u201d Lengel cautioned. Even if experts could verify the document\u2019s context and provenance\u2014a tough feat given the sophistication of today\u2019s forgeries\u2014Washington had several cousins also named George who grew up around the same time in Virginia, he explained. And while the signature on the illustration bears some resemblance to Washington\u2019s teenage handwriting, he was not known to abbreviate his first name as \u201cGeo.\u201d\nNevertheless, Lengel said, \u201cI\u2019m really excited by it because Washington\u2019s childhood is one of the great unknowns of his life. We know the general outline but what we don\u2019t really have is insight into what type of boy he was. What did he enjoy? What types of games did he play? What were his activities and pastimes?\u201d He said the sketch could also help debunk arguments that Washington floundered in school and was something of a hooligan. \u201cIf this thing is genuine it would be massively important and valuable,\u201d Lengel stressed.\nLingenfelter plans to exhibit the drawing to the public on March 11 at Pennsylvania\u2019s Moland House, which served as General Washington\u2019s headquarters in 1777.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Drawing By 10-Year-Old George Washington Found?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/george-washington-drawing.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/drawing-by-10-year-old-george-washington-found"}
