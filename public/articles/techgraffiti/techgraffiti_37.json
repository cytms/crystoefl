By offsetting the pollution, credits are used to prevent new pollution from being created in that amount. However, while this can help to limit new pollution it is not enough to protect the environment.\nBiofuels such as ethanol are not viable as alternative fuels for jet engines. Other fuels exist that not only burn clean but have a scrubbing effect on the atmosphere. This scrubbing effect helps to consume amounts of pollution in the air, reducing existing pollution while creating lower amounts when burned as fuel. Some types of alternative fuels such as those created from algae burn clean with no negative emissions. Alternate fuels that also allow for fewer refueling stops can lead to significantly less pollution.\nFinding more efficient methods of flight beyond fuel is equally important. Low emission plane engines would produce less pollution when combined with more viable forms of alternative fuel. Planes that are capable of making fewer stops would further contribute to lower pollution levels.","web_category":"environmentgreen-tech","advice_category":"3","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/images/Jumbo.jpg","title":"Flying on Alternative Fuels to Save the Planet","author":"Scotch"}
