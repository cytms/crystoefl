However, it looks like the solution may have just been found by three fishing enthusiasts from North Wales.\nThe three friends: an organic chemist and two engineers, claim to have developed a box that can be attached to cars, buses and even heavy industry. It is designed to trap carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and emit mostly water vapour. The box converts the noxious gases into biofuel using genetically modified algae, a discovery they came upon accidentally when exploring the algae’s potential uses in fish farming.\nThe trio have carried out more than 130 tests over two years and claim that the box reduced emissions by around 85%. They have the support of their local MP and are also in contact with a number of major car makers.","web_category":"environmentgreen-tech","advice_category":"3","picture_url":"http://aycu28.webshots.com/image/21867/2001090441015636412_rs.jpg","title":"Algae Could Trap Carbon Emissions While You Drive","author":"tom lyttelton"}
