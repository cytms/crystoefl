The photograph was taken at Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory (TSAO) near the Great Almaty Lake, which sits at 2800m altitude.\nIt’s obviously a good place for stargazing as there are three observatories in total in the Almaty region. As well as the TSAO (which thankfully isn’t all rusty) there’s also an Institute of Astrophysics on Kamenskoye plateau and the Assy-Turgen Observatory, which is located about 150 km to the north-east of the area. Budding astronomists can visit the observatories to study the life beyond the stars, while hikers looking for an adrenaline rush can tackle the nearby snowy peaks of the Tien Shan Mountains. And visitors in the winter months will be treated to great views of the constellations of Orion, Taurus, Gemini and planets of Jupiter, Saturn and Mars.\nSource \n, ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"3","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/images/http-inlinethumb56.webshots.com-39031-2721226690103830173S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Old Soviet Death-Ray Gun, Kazakhstan [PIC]","author":"Linda"}
