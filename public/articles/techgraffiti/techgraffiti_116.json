Here’s our Top 10 of precariously loaded trucks.\nThis truck looks like it’s loaded with pillows and tubs of food and is taking its passengers for a picnic but on a closer look, it’s loaded with sacks of sand or cement and the tubs look like they’re for work, not leisure…\n\nImage: \nSearching for a needle in a mobile haystack like this one should be extra difficult. Extra points for scenic location though.\n\nImage: \nThe next picture of a precariously loaded pick-up truck is remarkable not only for the colourful load but also for the driver’s enterprising spirit. He seems to be ready to sell right from the roof!\n\nImage: \nMoving one’s household can be a daunting task, especially if it has to fit onto one small truck! In this case, the photographer was driving down Route 1 and saw this truck with a California license plate on the way to Baja California.\n\nImage: \nOne has to admire the next packing job for artistic presentation – the load of this truck in India seeming to have been stacked by colours. Neat if slightly dangerous.\n\nImage via \nHere’s a colourful purple bus in West Bengal that kept on stacking the human load. Good it’s not raining.\n\nImage: \nHere’s an even more artistic and mixed-gender version in the Philippines. Don’t miss the guy sitting coolly on the hood and the one hanging at the back!\n\nImage: \nThe next heavily decorated and heavily loaded vehicle looks half truck, half gypsy camper van. And what is that humongous load? Let’s hope it’s something light, maybe just hot air?\n\nImage: \nWell, the next truck in Shen County in East China’s Shandong Province was clearly overloaded! Luckily, no one was hurt but the driver and his unfortunate incident must’ve surely been all over the news.\n\nImage via \nThe number one spot goes to not one but two trucks somewhere in the African desert, both equally loaded with parts, parcels and humans. Don’t miss the ladder attached to the truck on the left. Jumping clearly seems out of the question!\n\nImage via ","web_category":"productsgear","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/images/http-inlinethumb51.webshots.com-42290-2282547790104237032S425x425Q85.jpg","title":"Precariously Loaded Trucks","author":"Simone Preuss"}
