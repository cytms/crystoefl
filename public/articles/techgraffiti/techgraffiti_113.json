The Smoke Pencil and the Chimney Balloon are two very useful tools to air-seal your home, but they look a little dubious at first…\nUndeniably the name \n is pure genius. It’s a neat little device that allows you to detect draughts in buildings – all you have to do is whip it out, pull the trigger and watch for which way the non-toxic smoke drifts, allowing you to pinpoint any pesky draughts.

Dubbed the ‘super-galactic prophylactic’, use it to plug up your old fireplaces, skylights, or even garbage chute. Using a Chimney Balloon will leave you feeling warm this winter, and go a long way towards cutting down your energy bills – something we definitely approve of here at Environmental Graffiti.\nHead over to \n and check out these cool little gadgets.","web_category":"productsgear","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/images/http-inlinethumb30.webshots.com-14877-2933171220103691965S600x600Q85_0.jpg","title":"Is That a Smoke Pencil in Your Handbag, or... ?","author":"Thomas Davie"}
