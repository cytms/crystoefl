In most cases, more greenhouse gases were produced during the manufacturing of the turbine then saved during use.\n“These studies have shown a large variation in the expected CO2 payback periods from a few months in good locations to situations where they never pay back, in poor locations.”\nSimmons also blogs at \nVia :: ","web_category":"environmentgreen-tech","advice_category":"3","picture_url":"/sites/default/files/images/1338373865532368941.jpg","title":"Home Wind Turbines Produce More CO2 Than They Save","author":"Simmons"}
