{"url":"http://www.techgraffiti.com//news-flying-car-sets-sahara","content":"\nThink back to when you were a kid, watching endless re-runs of Chitty-chitty Bang-bang. Truthfully, how many times did you close your eyes and wish for a flying car? And how many times have you been on a tortuous lengthy road trip wishing you’d flown? Well, very soon, you could have the best of both worlds, just like British inventor Giles Cardozo.\nHe has painstakingly constructed a flying car, and it works! Amazingly well. Given the not-very-inventive name of ‘Skycar’, this biofuel-powered motor is able to go from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds. Add a powerful fan to the back and it has a lift-off speed of around 45 mph. Not bad for what is technically a dune buggy.\nDesigned to convert from car to aircraft within minutes, the Skycar is fitted with a paraglider-style canopy and uses parajet technology, which took 18 months to develop. Once airborne the nippy little Chitty can cruise 2-3,000 ft above the ground for a range of 160 miles, and up to 15,000 ft altitude.\n\nThe Skycar team took off on its inaugural flight from London, England this morning, a trip that will see the flying contraption crossing France, Spain and the north of Africa, crossing the Sahara before landing in the Malinese city of Timbuktu.\nNeil Laughton, an ex-SAS man, will head expedition and be followed by a ground suppoet team of 13 people. They plan to arrive in Timbuktu on February 20, all things going well.\nSource \n, \n, ","web_category":"science","advice_category":"3","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/images/http-inlinethumb29.webshots.com-40988-2453201870103830173S600x600Q85.jpg","title":"Flying Car Sets Off for the Sahara","author":"Linda"}
