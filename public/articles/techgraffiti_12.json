The results blend an old-fashioned, almost romantic aesthetic with an edgy tech-focused feel.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cFragmentation\u201d\nThe fantastic textures seen in these works of art are created by pasting the assorted pieces and parts onto canvas. The artist then skillfully colors her work using a mixture of inks and sprays. With these collages, she manages to transform recycling from a practical, mundane activity into a process for creating objects of beauty.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cInviting the Wind\u201d (detail)\nIt doesn\u2019t matter where you look \u2013 there\u2019s always something interesting in the detail. Sometimes the objects used are obvious, while other times the paint and positioning can make them almost unrecognizable. Yet of course, seeing if you can identify the items is all part of the fun.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cFragmentation\u201d (detail)\nIn this gorgeous piece, titled \u201cFragmentation\u201d, the beautiful jewel-like tones of the greens really stand out. What items can you identify? \u201cThere is a time when you simply have to do something or you\u2019ll die in creative pain, suffocated with things that want to come out,\u201d says Finnabair. \u201cOr your head will explode leaving a hard-to-remove stain on the wall.\u201d Now that\u2019s graphic!\nImage: Finnabair\u201cFragmentation\u201d (detail)\nAs you can imagine, creating an artwork like this, which measures 20 x 27.5 inches (50 x 70 cm), requires much in the way of collecting materials. Luckily, Finnabair, who also teaches scrapbooking and mixed media around the world, is able to get a lot of the \u201cjunk treasures\u201d she needs from friends and students.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cThe Wanderer\u201d\nFinnabair has \u201ctentatively\u201d named this creation \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d. Here, the palette is mostly shimmering blues and gold. If you look carefully, you should be able to spot bits of motherboards, USB plugs, hard drives and memory chips mixed in with pretty pieces of lace. A piece like this can take Finnabair up to 15 hours to make \u2013 and that\u2019s not including drying time. Still, the results speak for themselves.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cThe Wanderer\u201d (detail)\nHere\u2019s a close-up look at some of the amazing detail of \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d. Considering the painstaking process of placing every piece, it\u2019s easy to see why each artwork takes Finnabair so much time to put together. According to the artist, taking photographs of works like this can be tricky: \u201cIt is so hard to make a good shot if the color palette is between whites, blues, greens and golds, and all the dimensional details are hard to focus on,\u201d she says.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cInviting the Wind\u201d\nThis piece, whimsically titled \u201cInviting the Wind\u201d, has a square-shaped hole in it \u2013 but that\u2019s okay: it\u2019s part of the creation! Again, you could spend a great deal of time identifying the various interesting components used in the piece, which include USB plugs, memory cards, and other computer parts, along with softer elements like lace and twine.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cInviting the Wind\u201d (detail)\n\u201cMy biggest concern was the window \u2013 yes, there is a hole in the middle of it! It was meant to be one of the most important elements of this collage,\u201d Finnabair recalls. \u201cNow, when it is done, I can say I\u2019m quite close to the idea I had, but in a more \u2018painting-like way\u2019, which makes me happy as a small crocodile and pushes me further to try more.\u201d\nImage: Finnabair\u201cArt Saves\u201d\nThis collage blends a pink heart with the word \u2018art\u2019 as well as a hint of the macabre \u2013 in the form of a dead moth. To us, it looks like art is breathing life into the machine. Finnabair, who has dubbed this piece \u201cArt Saves\u201d, describes the piece thus: \u201cI think the message is visible and easy \u2013 art is freedom, and freedom is nothing but a state of mind.\u201d\nImage: Finnabair\u201cArt Saves\u201d (detail)\n\u201cThere are a lot of gears and mechanisms \u2013 the embodiment of the process, energy and feelings are delicate flowers\u2026 elements of nature in the midst of scrap metal,\u201d says Finnabair. It is this combination of hard and delicate qualities that gives her work such wonderful character.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cArt Saves\u201d (detail)\n\u201cAnd, of course, [there] is a moth, my symbol and the most perfect metaphor which describes me,\u201d Finnabair says of this little painted insect. It just goes to show that with the right treatment and placement, almost anything can become a work of art \u2013 or at least part of one.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cArt Saves\u201d (detail)\nHere\u2019s another look at some of the elaborate detail of Finnabair\u2019s \u201cArt Saves\u201d collage. \u201cWhen I saw this motherboard I saw beauty in it \u2013 a labyrinth of paths, interesting elements, square and round objects\u2026 it was a kind of industrial beauty I really liked,\u201d explains Finnabair.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cArtysta (The Artist)\u201d (detail)\nThis fantastic creation is called \u201cArtysta\u201d, which means \u201cThe Artist\u201d in Polish. We just love the vibrant gold and coppery colors. The collage also features flowers, light bulbs, gears, and metal charms. Finnabair\u2019s art makes us want to touch it and feel all the textures, as well as look at and admire it from afar.\nImage: Finnabair\u201cFragmentation\u201d (detail)\nFinding beauty in what others might call junk is, of course, a required skill when it comes to creating recycled art. But translating that beauty so that others can also appreciate it is another, and perhaps even bigger, challenge. Finnabair certainly seems to overcome both of these hurdles with her delightful collages.\nFinnabair describes her art as more than just a job or hobby: \u201cIt gives me moments when I forget about the world, working hard [in my] head, hands translate, paint, stick\u2026 I cannot stop.\u201d Looking at these beautiful and intriguing creations, we hope she never does.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4","author":"Yohani Kamarudin","web_category":"art-design","title":"Steampunk Collages Created from Recycled Computer Parts","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/2012/11/mb1d.jpg","url":"http://www.techgraffiti.com/stunning-art-made-from-computer-parts"}
