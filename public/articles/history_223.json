The act draws crowds as large as 25,000 people. Blondin crosses in increasingly difficult ways, riding a bicycle, pushing a wheelbarrow and even with his hands and legs bound in chains. His most difficult crossing takes place on August 19, when he manages to carry his manager over the rope on his back.\nJuly 15, 1885 \nThe Niagara Reservation State Park opens, attracting 750,000 visitors. It is the first state park established in the United States.\n1887\nTwenty years after the last crossing, Niagara Falls claims its first\u2014and only\u2014tightrope victim when the body of Stephen Peer, a local Ontario native, is discovered. Just days before, Peer had made several successful trips, and authorities determine that he died after a botched attempt at a nighttime crossing.\nSeptember 6, 1890\nThree years after Peer\u2019s death, Samuel Dixon uses the same cable as Peer to make several successful crossings while performing a variety of stunts.\nOctober 12, 1892\nToronto\u2019s Clifford Calverly sets the record for the fastest crossing across the gorge. He makes his way across a 3/4-inch steel cable in just 6 minutes, 33.5 seconds.\nJuly 1896\nThe last tightrope crossing for more than 115 years is completed by 21-year-old James Hardy.\nJuly 11, 1920\nCharles Stephens, the second man to go over the falls, takes the plunge in a 600-pound oak barrel. The force of the water rips the barrel apart, and Stephens is killed. His right arm is the only part of him to be recovered.\nJuly 4, 1928\nJean Lussier goes over the falls inside a 6-foot rubber ball lined with oxygen-filled rubber tubes. He survives and afterwards earns extra money by selling pieces of the ball\u2019s rubber tubes.\nJuly 4, 1930\nAdventurer George Stathakis goes over the falls in a 10-foot, 1-ton wooden barrel. Sadly, however, Stathakis\u2019 barrel is caught behind the falls for 14 hours. With only enough air to live for three hours, Stathakis dies before he is rescued, but his 105-year-old pet turtle, Sonny Boy, survives the trip.\nAugust 5, 1951\nRed Hill Jr. braves Horseshoe Falls on what he calls \u201cthe thing,\u201d a flimsily constructed raft made of 13 inner tubes tied together with rope and enclosed in a fish net. Soon after his plunge, the raft\u2019s inner tubes begin popping to the surface of the river, but there is no sign of Hill. His bruised body is not recovered until the next day.\nSeptember 27, 1989\nCanadians Peter DeBernardi and Geoffrey Petkovich become the first team to go over the falls together, enclosed face to face in a single barrel. They survive with minor injuries.\nJune 5, 1990\nJessie Sharp, who hopes to advance his career as a stuntman by going over Niagara Falls, attempts the feat in a whitewater kayak without a helmet or a life vest. His body is never recovered.\nOctober 1, 1995\nRobert Overacker tries to go over the falls on a jet ski. The 15th person since 1901 to attempt the feat, he does not survive.\nJune 18, 1995\nSteven Trotter and Lori Martin become the first man and woman to make it over the falls together in one barrel. Since then, the regulatory body that governs the falls, the Niagara Parks Commission (NPC), has refused to issue permits for stunts. The first exception has been granted to daredevil Nik Wallenda. In the future, the NPC plans to issue permits just \u201conce in a generation,\u201d or roughly every 20 years.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"A Daredevil History of Niagara Falls","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/niagara-falls.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/a-daredevil-history-of-niagara-falls"}
