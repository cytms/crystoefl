That\u2019s right, there are zombie cockroaches. I\u2019m sorry, but if you\u2019re not frightened by the thought of billions of undead cockroaches swarming the globe, you\u2019ve got issues.\nOnly it turns out we may not really have to worry about the living insect dead. Cockroaches are turned into \u201czombies\u201d only by the sting of a tropical wasp, which then lays eggs in the stomach of the hapless creature that slowly feasts on its still living corpse for days and days.\nThe wasp is called the jewel wasp, also known as the emerald cockroach wasp, and it\u2019s found in most of the tropics. You might think that like many other venomous insects it merely paralyzes the cockroach. You\u2019d be wrong. The wasp stings its victims twice. The first sting paralyzes the front legs of the insect. The second sting is more sinister. The wasp takes careful aim for the zombifying (I don\u2019t think this is a real word but it seems appropriate) blow. Its second sting is delivered directly into a small section of the roach\u2019s brain called the protocerebrum.\nThe venom in the brain blocks a chemical called octopamine. Octopamine controls alertness, movement and physical ability in roaches. When it is blocked, the roach essentially loses its free will to move.\nResearchers at Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University made the discovery. They also found a way to dezombify the roaches. By injecting octopamine into the protocerebrum of roaches that had already been stung by the wasps, the roaches were able to regain their free will and ability to move.\nJewel wasps aren\u2019t the only ones who turn their hosts into the aforementioned zombies. A study by French biologists found that a parasite called the hairworm can take over the brain and body of grasshoppers and make them kill themselves. The parasite uses a combination of chemicals to cause its host to jump into a body of water and drown, at which point the adult hairworm will leave the body to mate in its watery breeding grounds.\nI hope this information is being carefully recorded by leading zombie researchers. Should the future hold giant hordes of human zombies, I intend to be well prepared with a shotgun, a head chopping machete and a fistful of octopamine syringes. There will be no welcome for our new zombie overlords from this eco-warrior.\nIf you want to find out more about zombie preparedness or creepy insects, why not subcribe to our RSS feed, we'll even give you a free album.\n ","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Scientists Discover the Undead in the Tropics","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/2786710020df2ee3eddbzjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/scientists-discover-the-undead-in-the-tropics/584"}
