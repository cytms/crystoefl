Such is the beauty of Canadian artist Gregory Colbert\u2019s photography in his exhibit Ashes and Snow.\nPhoto: Grogory Colbert\nIn this traveling exhibition, the work explores the \u201cshared poetic sensibilities of human beings and animals\u201d. \nPhoto: Gregory Colbert\n\nAnd poetic it is. Ashes and Snow started as novel about a traveler who composes 365 letters to his wife during the course of a year long journey.\nThe novel then turned into these soul stirring photographs\u2026Photo: ? Gregory Colbert\n \nwhich then turned into a film.Photo: ? Gregory Colbert\n\nTo capture these photos, Colbert traveled to more than 60 locations including India, Burma, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tonga, Namibia, and Antarctica to film and photograph interactions between human beings and animals. Elephants, whales, manatees, sacred ibis, cheetahs, leopards, baboons, meerkats, gibbons, orangutans, and saltwater crocodiles are among the animals that he has filmed and photographed. Human subjects include Burmese monks, trance dancers, San people, and other indigenous peoples from around the world. To date, Colbert has collaborated with over 130 species.Photo: ?
