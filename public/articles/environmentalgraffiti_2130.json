From Nowpublic.com\nFrontotemporal dementia, paired with a phenomenon called synesthesia, is apparently behind the beauty of Bolero, a masterpiece of composition and painting.\nThe prevailing logic on the way dementia works is that it strikes the brain in a disparate fashion, simply removing one's ability. As the various incarnations of Bolero show us, that's not the case.  In the early stages, before dementia becomes detectable, it weakens once-dominant areas of the brain, which rather than manifesting itself, is bypassed by the mind.\nAs certain abilities weaken, others will increasingly compensate; a primary reason that Dr. Adams, a Canadian mathematics professor, found herself driven to paint in her late 50s.\nIt's not until far later, when the disease is affecting larger areas of the brain that functions become impaired and the negative symptoms set in.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
