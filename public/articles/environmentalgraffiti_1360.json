Spectacular certainly, but as extreme action goes it all seems rather British. This is horse surfing. Yes, horse surfing. Just the name of this new spin on board sports is enough to raise a few eyebrows \u2013 neigh, even elicit a few WTFs \u2013 but as with anything, don\u2019t pooh-pooh it before you\u2019ve given it a pop.\nPhoto: Photo: David Spurdens\nHorse surfing is a relatively recent addition to the list of more bizarre extreme sports. It\u2019s similar to kite surfing and wakeboarding \u2013 whose boards have been adapted to this equine equivalent \u2013 but instead of harnessing the force of the wind or the thrust of a speedboat, horse surfers literally harness the power of the horse. A tow rope is attached to a special saddle, and the boarder is dragged along as horse and rider thunder along the shoreline. \u201cLike environmentally friendly wakeboarding,\u201d is how guinea pig kite surfer Denzil Williams described it.\nPhoto: Photo: Extreme Horse Riding\nUnfortunately, all this means horse surfing isn\u2019t about some gnarly anthropomorphised bronco waxing up his very own surfboard and taking to the waves \u2013 but we\u2019ll let that slide. As in wakeboarding, the boarder starts squatting in the water, feet strapped to the board while holding a bar attached to a tow rope. Then they dig the board in as the horse moves away and begin to pick up speed \u2013 and if pounding along at 30 to 40 mph isn\u2019t a big enough buzz for you, those with the skills can start pulling off tricks to get chicks.\nPhoto: Photo: David Spurdens via Extreme Horse Riding \nThe guy who got hit by the brainwave of combining the power of the horse with the power of the swell was trick rider Daniel Fowler-Prime. Bored on a British beach back in 2005, Daniel hooked up with a couple of kite surfer buddies to begin wet running the then colt of a sport. Understandably, there were nerves at first about being at the mercy of an animal with its own temperament, but this unpredictability is part of the rush \u2013 and there\u2019s always a trained rider at hand in case the stallion gets too spirited, or the filly too feisty.\nPhoto: Photo: Extreme Horse Riding\nDaniel himself is an extreme horse rider by trade, so hanging off the side of a galloping horse is how he gets his kicks \u2013 and in fact makes his living \u2013 doing live shows and appearing in films including The Da Vinci Code with his partner, thoroughbred Rohan. Asked to distinguish between his experiences in the saddle and those strapped to a board, Daniel told Environmental Graffiti:\n\u201cFrom the point of view of tricks and the adrenalin rush, extreme horse riding is a lot more intense. With the horse surfing, like any surfing, it can be quite hectic or quite pleasant \u2013 it depends on your mood and how you\u2019re surfing.  It depends on the horses too. Obviously different horses do have a different feel \u2013 some can be quite smooth, some quite powerful and aggressive.\u201d\nPhoto: Photo via Kiteboarding News \nAnd the sense of living slightly on edge while horse surfing comes from the sea\u2019s side as well as the horse\u2019s. \u201cUnlike in normal surfing, you don\u2019t want too much in terms of waves,\" explains Daniel. \"The board needs just of few inches of water. The secret to getting speed is to stay as shallow as possible \u2013 but it\u2019s a gamble too because if you catch the sand with your board you\u2019re going to fall down hard.\u201d\nFace plant. Nice. Still, such risks haven\u2019t deterred Daniel nor indeed stopped horse surfing from spreading to other shores. After the splash that was made a couple of years ago, other horse surfers have followed suit. Here\u2019s a vid from Australia to prove it, complete with tricks, though these guys are using wakeboards:\nVisit Extreme Horse Riding to find out more or to book yourself onto a course.\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
