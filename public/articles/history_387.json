(He was also part of the team that described Titanoboa in 2009.) The extinct species belonged to the dyrosaurid family of crocodyliforms, which stalked coastal regions around the world from 75 to 35 million years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few families that transcends the event that killed off all the dinosaurs,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cDinosaurs have all been snuffed out, and dyrosaurids actually do much better than they did before.\u201d\nAcherontisuchus guajiraensis, which was unearthed in the same Colombian coalmine as Titanoboa, could offer some insight into the dyrosaurids\u2019 staying power, Hastings said. Its discovery challenges the prevailing theory that, like today\u2019s saltwater crocodiles, dyrosaurids spent their youth basking in freshwater rivers, where they couldn\u2019t fall prey to their hungry elders, but primarily dwelled in the ocean. Even as adults, Acherontisuchus guajiraensis lived upstream of the Caribbean in a broad, slow-moving river, steering clear of the rolling shoreline\u2014and encroaching upon Titanoboa\u2019s territory as a result.\nSince the researchers only uncovered three identifiable adult specimens, some might be tempted to guess that a few individuals simply swam off course and died outside their natural habitat, Hastings said. But Acherontisuchus guajiraensis featured physical adaptations specific to a freshwater lifestyle, including an elongated snout and pointy teeth for ensnaring slippery river fish, he explained. It also lacked the unique muscle and bone structure marine crocodiles use to stay afloat in turbulent waves. \u201cNot only are they living there, but they\u2019ve been there for long enough to evolve to inhabit that kind of environment,\u201d Hastings said.\nAcherontisuchus guajiraensis (and possibly other dyrosaurids) may have migrated away from their relatives\u2019 coastal adobe in order to outlast the event that polished off the dinosaurs, according to Hastings. It\u2019s possible, for instance, that the cataclysm\u2014thought to have been a giant meteor strike\u2014sapped the ancient crocodiles\u2019 marine food supply. \u201cAt the age of the dinosaurs, not only do you have all these big reptiles on land but you also have these large reptiles at sea, such as mosasaurs,\u201d said Hastings. \u201cThey all die out too. One of the things that likely enabled [dyrosaurids] to survive is their ability to take on freshwater habitats as well as marine habitats. If you can adapt to change and live in multiple habitats, you increase your chances of survival.\u201d\nBut a new peril lurked under and around the placid waters of the river where Acherontisuchus guajiraensis made its home: Titanoboa, a massive boa as long as a school bus that weighed in at 2,500 pounds and snacked on fish when it wasn\u2019t swallowing giant turtles and crocodiles. To understand the relationship between these extinct neighbors, Hastings and his colleagues observed two similar reptiles that live side by side\u2014and, often, at each other\u2019s throats\u2014in today\u2019s Amazon. Though hardly reaching titanic proportions, anacondas can grow 20 to 30 feet long and have been known to devour wild pigs, deer and even jaguars. They also compete for food with (and occasionally eat) caimans, which are South American alligators less than half their size. \u201cIn certain circumstances one has to worry about the other and vice versa,\u201d Hastings said.\nFrom their modern equivalents, we can assume that tensions ran high between Acherontisuchus guajiraensis and Titanoboa as they squabbled over fish and threatened one another\u2019s offspring. \u201cYoung individuals of this new crocodile were definitely not safe from Titanoboa,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have taken much for one of these large snakes to pick off babies and juveniles.\u201d At the same time, he added, \u201cadult crocs could have eaten baby Titanoboa, and in a lot of cases you\u2019ll see caimans eating baby anacondas.\u201d\nThe researchers have yet to determine whether Acherontisuchus guajiraensis outlived its serpentine adversary and endured until all dyrosaurids went extinct roughly 35 million years ago. \u201cRight now there\u2019s just one place and one time that we have these fossils from,\u201d said Hastings. \u201cThey may have survived later. Our hope is to explore further into Colombia to understand if they continued on.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Did Ancient Crocodiles Clash With History\u2019s Largest Snakes?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ancient-croc.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/did-ancient-crocodiles-clash-with-historys-largest-snakes"}
