He and other scholars have gleaned valuable knowledge about the gladiatorial lifestyle from the epitaphs the ancient fighters left behind, learning, for example, that most of them were married and went by stage names. Typically, the inscriptions also included the deceased gladiator\u2019s lifetime statistics\u2014how many fights ended in a win, loss or draw\u2014and a statement chalking his ultimate demise up to fate.\nThe tombstone of Diodorus, a Turkish-born gladiator who died some 1,800 years ago, diverges from the others, providing a visual snapshot as well as a written account of the doomed man\u2019s final showdown. It bears an engraved image of a gladiator holding two swords and looming above a fallen opponent who is making a gesture of submission. In Carter\u2019s interpretation, the scene depicts Diodorus standing triumphantly over his yielding rival, fully expecting the referee\u2014\u201csumma rudis\u201d in Latin\u2014to call the game in his favor.\nAs the accompanying epitaph shows, this is not what came to pass. The full text reads: \u201cHere I lie victorious, Diodorus the wretched. After breaking my opponent Demetrius, I did not kill him immediately. But murderous Fate and the cunning treachery of the summa rudis killed me, and leaving the light I have gone to Hades. I lie in the land of the original inhabitants. A good friend buried me here because of his piety.\u201d\nIn other studies of gladiator gravestones, Carter has explored this unique example, which was discovered a century ago in northern Turkey and is now part of the collection at Brussels\u2019 Mus?e du Cinquantenaire. Previously, he focused on the epitaph\u2019s assertion that, at one point during the battle, Diodorus intentionally decided not to kill Demetrius. This time, in a paper published in the journal Zeitschrift f?r Papyrologie und Epigraphik (Journal for Papyrology and Ancient Epigraphics), Carter investigates Diodorus\u2019 second posthumous claim: that a \u201ctreacherous\u201d ref\u2019s blown call sent him to an early grave\u2014in an era long before instant replay could have saved him.\nFor Carter, who studies gladiator contests and other spectacles in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, Diodorus\u2019 tombstone adds to a growing body of evidence that gladiatorial combat was not the fight-to-the-death free-for-all in which the only governing principle was to kill the opponent, as certain Hollywood blockbusters would have us believe. \u201cThis epitaph seems to me to reveal the existence of a rule that if a gladiator fell accidentally, then he was to be allowed to get up again and the fight to resume,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was acceptable for one gladiator to push or knock over his opponent\u2014deliberately\u2014which is what Diodorus claims to have done in the inscription. The referee, however, must have interpreted the fall to have been accidental, and so allowed Demetrius to get up again, retrieve his weapon and shield and resume the fight.\u201d Had the summa rudis made the right call, the game would have ended with both gladiators still alive.\nCarter is one of many historians who now think that Roman fighters played by a strict set of rules enforced by experienced arbiters, many of whom were former champions themselves. A 2006 study by Austrian researchers, for instance, suggested that creeping up to deliver a stealthy clout on the back of the head was likely prohibited. And ancient records indicate that, while amateur combatants nearly always died in the arena or were so badly wounded that waiting executioners killed them with one merciful blow, an estimated 90 percent of trained gladiators lived to see more combat.\n\u201cI think that common perception holds that gladiatorial games were simply about one gladiator killing another in any manner possible and that the Romans who came to watch wanted to see simple spectacles of homicide,\u201d Carter explained. \u201cBut if there were rules that governed the combats, with \u2018referees\u2019 to enforce them, and if victorious gladiators who had their defeated opponent at their mercy\u2014as Diodorus did here\u2014deliberately chose not to kill him, then the fights had to have been about something other than just killing. I\u2014and others\u2014argue that they were about winning ostentatious victory, displaying skill, bravery and discipline.\u201d\nCarter likened Diodorus to the victim of one of recent history\u2019s most infamous blown calls: Detroit Tigers pitcher Armondo Galarraga, who suffered the consequences of an umpire\u2019s botched ruling last June. Fortunately for Galarraga, the fan-enraging decision only cost him a once-in-a-lifetime shot at a perfect game, not his life itself.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Gladiator Cries Foul Over Ref\u2019s Blown Call From the Grave","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/gladiator-thumb1.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/gladiator-cries-foul-over-refs-blown-call-from-the-grave"}
