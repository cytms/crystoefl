With a PhD in Applied Physics, Lang has built a career out of applying his knowledge of mathematics and engineering to the very ancient art of paper folding \u2013 with spectacular results:\nPhoto: \nImage: Wikimedia Commons\nNoted particularly for his incredibly intricate models of insects, spiders and other anthropoids, Lang has designed and folded well over 500 original designs ranging from the elegant simplicity of a leaping fox to the ornate extravagance of the Black Forest cuckoo clock. What\u2019s amazing is that each piece has been constructed from only a single sheet of paper.\nPhoto: \nImage: Fg2\nHis expertise has also been called on by physicists at a laboratory in California to assist in the creation of an 80-foot wide space telescope, an instrument so large that it would be impossible for existing spacecraft to successfully transport it into orbit. The solution?  Engineer a lens that can be folded into a compact package before being unfurled in space, an audacious feat dependent on the basic principles of paper-folding as articulated by Lang.\nAnyone interested in Lang\u2019s earth-bound creations will be pleased to know that he accepts commissions \u2013 which unsurprisingly will set you back anywhere between US$200 to $3,000. And if you haven't got that amount of spare cash floating around, at least you know how to turn your scrap paper into art!\nSource: Lang Origami\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
