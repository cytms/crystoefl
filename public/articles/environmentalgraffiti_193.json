He got his first camera at the age 16, and soon became as passionate about photography as he was about nature. After his first photography expedition, to an Australian rainforest in 1990, he decided to explore other such environments around the world. Recalling his first trip, he explains: \"It was the rainy season and the forest was bursting with life. It was hot, humid, noisy and completely exhilarating, but most exciting of all was the wildlife. I was immediately hooked.\u201d\nPhoto: ? Thomas MarentPygmy seahorse, no bigger than a little fingernail\nSo far Thomas has written various books about wildlife photography, including Life in the Wild, all of which are full of amazing photos of wild animals. Thomas was happy to share his experience of shooting in the wild. He said: \u201cIt was often a wonderful experience to shoot animals in the wild and to be face to face with them, but it is also a hard work among those conditions in nature. But it has always been my great passion and I am glad showing to the people the beauty of the wildlife.\"\nA question that came to mind was, 'How can we protect wildlife, different habitats and our natural resources?' Thomas gave us his thoughts: \u201cPeople should have more awareness for nature,\" he said. \"Unfortunately people don\u2019t really care if species disappear. We should stop the over population. Nature conservation should be a bigger issue for everyone. We have to protect the forests and all kinds of untouched wilderness with its animals. We should stop the money and greedy people which destroy the natural resources. We have to stop the poachers.\u201d\nPhoto: DK Images/?Thomas Marent\nLastly, we were interested in Thomas' opinion on the dwindling wildlife population. His message to readers? \u201cThe loss of the habitat and the poaching is the main problem. The whole world is overpopulated by humans and there is not enough space for the other species.\u201d\nOur sincere thanks to Thomas Marent for taking the time to answer our questions and to DK Images for providing the photos used in this article.","author":"Alka Sharma","web_category":"nature","title":"Life in the Wild with Photographer Thomas Marent","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Baby5_1.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-life-wild-amazing-portray-wildlife"}
