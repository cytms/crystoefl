Both discussed the findings of a recent study that used non-invasive computerized tomography (CT) scans on 52 mummies\u2014including the princess\u2019\u2014to determine whether ancient Egyptians suffered from atherosclerosis. This chronic condition, in which fatty deposits build up in the arteries and increase the risk of heart attack or stroke, affects more people today than all forms of cancer combined.\nAtherosclerosis has often been associated with unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles\u2014risk factors believed to be more common in modern humans than in ancient peoples. For this reason, the researchers who scanned the mummies were surprised to discover that, out of the 44 with recognizable arteries, nearly half showed signs of arterial calcification, which indicates atherosclerosis.\n\u201cOverall, it was striking how much atherosclerosis we found,\u201d said Gregory S. Thomas, director of nuclear cardiology education at the University of California, Irvine, and a lead on the study. \u201cWe think of atherosclerosis as a disease of modern lifestyle, but it\u2019s clear that it also existed 3,500 years ago. Our findings certainly call into question the perception of atherosclerosis as a modern disease.\u201d\nPrincess Ahmose-Meryet-Amon presented with the most extreme case of all: Calcium deposits in two of her three main coronary arteries imply that she suffered from life-threatening\u2014and possibly fatal\u2014heart disease when she died. \u201cToday,\u201d Thomas explained, \u201cshe would have needed bypass surgery.\u201d\nFor Thomas and the study\u2019s other principal investigator, Adel Allam of Al Azhar University in Cairo, their findings indicate that atherosclerosis may have a more significant genetic link than previously thought. Allam also suggested that ancient Egyptians might have been particularly susceptible to coronary heart disease because of exposure to parasites that triggered an inflammatory response and compromised their immune systems.\nThe team also believes that a dietary explanation could still be on the table, especially for Ahmose-Meryet-Amon: Because the princess belonged to a royal family, she probably indulged in richer foods than the average Egyptian, consuming higher quantities of meat, butter, cheese and salt, which was used as a preservative. (For commoners, typical fare centered on fruits, vegetables, wheat, barley, bread and beer.) As a member of the elite, Ahmose-Meryet-Amon may also have been spared the strenuous daily routines of her father and brother\u2019s subjects.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Egyptian Princess Needed Bypass Surgery, Mummy Study Shows","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mummy-scan.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/egyptian-princess-needed-bypass-surgery-mummy-study-shows"}
