Depicting \"A Wheat Field with Cypresses\", the wall is made from 8,000 plants and can be seen in London's Trafalgar Square!\nPhoto: GE/Ecomagination\nThe piece was chosen because it allowed a variety of depths and colors, and over 500 hours of work went into choosing the plants and getting the best matches for the painting. A numbered drawing was done to get the plants organized on the large wall.\nPhoto: GE/Ecomagination\nThis will be no easy task to keep up for the summer. It is going to take 120 to 200 liters of water a day and at least 132 man hours, but it will highlight the partnership of GE and the National Gallery in a project to reduce the gallery's carbon footprint by 40%.\nPhoto: GE/Ecomagination\nPeople who see the living wall can participate as well by taking photos and sending them to #GElivingwall on Twitter. All the photos will then be made into a mosaic of the painting at their Facebook page.\nPhoto: GE/Ecomagination\nNeedless to say, reducing carbon footprints is vital in today's world with climate change and global warming. Wonderful pieces like this highlight the importance of it.
