There wasn\u2019t a fire or home intrusion; No, there was merely proof of Bigfoot.\n?\nThe conversation went like this, according to a partial transcript of the police recording:\nPerson 1: \u201c[an individual] called 911 advising that he contacted the Game Commission to call him back; wants a police officer to come to his residence. Apparently he has proof there of Bigfoot.\u201d\n?\nOfficer: \u201cBigfoot, right?\u201d\n?\nPerson 1: \u201cThat\u2019s affirmative, he has evidence, uh \u2026 proving Bigfoot. He would like a police officer to come there.\u201d\n\nObviously, no self-respecting police department would ignore such an emergency, so a police officer was dispatched to the scene.\n?\nWhat followed has all the markings of the typical sensational scenario: Bigfoot believers quickly heard about it and rumors began running amok.
