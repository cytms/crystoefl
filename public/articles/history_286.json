Though in favor of maximizing daylight waking hours, Benjamin Franklin did not originate the idea of moving clocks forward. \nBy the time he was a 78-year-old American envoy in Paris in 1784, the man who espoused the virtues of \u201cearly to bed and early to rise\u201d was not practicing what he preached. After being unpleasantly stirred from sleep at 6 a.m. by the summer sun, the founding father penned a satirical essay in which he calculated that Parisians, simply by waking up at dawn, could save the modern-day equivalent of $200 million through \u201cthe economy of using sunshine instead of candles.\u201d As a result of this essay, Franklin is often erroneously given the honor of \u201cinventing\u201d daylight saving time, but he only proposed a change in sleep schedules\u2014not the time itself.\n3. Englishman William Willett led the first campaign to implement daylight saving time.\nWhile on an early-morning horseback ride around the desolate outskirts of London in 1905, Willett had an epiphany that the United Kingdom should move its clocks forward by 80 minutes between April and October so that more people could enjoy the plentiful sunlight. The Englishman published the 1907 brochure \u201cThe Waste of Daylight\u201d and spent much of his personal fortune evangelizing with missionary zeal for the adoption of \u201csummer time.\u201d Year after year, however, the British Parliament stymied the measure, and Willett died in 1915 at age 58 without ever seeing his idea come to fruition.\n4. Germany was the first country to enact daylight saving time. \nIt took World War I for Willett\u2019s dream to come true, but on April 30, 1916, Germany embraced daylight saving time to conserve electricity. (He may have been horrified to learn that Britain\u2019s wartime enemy followed his recommendations before his homeland.) Weeks later, the United Kingdom followed suit and introduced \u201csummer time.\u201d \n5. Daylight saving time in the United States was not intended to benefit farmers, as many people think. \nContrary to popular belief, American farmers did not lobby for daylight saving to have more time to work in the fields; in fact, the agriculture industry was deeply opposed to the time switch when it was first implemented on March 31, 1918, as a wartime measure. The sun, not the clock, dictated farmers\u2019 schedules, so daylight saving was very disruptive. Farmers had to wait an extra hour for dew to evaporate to harvest hay, hired hands worked less since they still left at the same time for dinner and cows weren\u2019t ready to be milked an hour earlier to meet shipping schedules. Agrarian interests led the fight for the 1919 repeal of national daylight saving time, which passed after Congress voted to override President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s veto. Rather than rural interests, it has been urban entities such as retail outlets and recreational businesses that have championed daylight saving over the decades. \n6. For decades, daylight saving in the United States was a confounding patchwork of local practices.\nAfter the national repeal in 1919, some states and cities, including New York City and Chicago, continued to shift their clocks. National daylight saving time returned during World War II, but after its repeal three weeks after war\u2019s end the confusing hodgepodge resumed. States and localities could start and end daylight saving whenever they pleased, a system that Time magazine (an aptly named source) described in 1963 as \u201ca chaos of clocks.\u201d In 1965 there were 23 different pairs of start and end dates in Iowa alone, and St. Paul, Minnesota, even began daylight saving two weeks before its twin city, Minneapolis. Passengers on a 35-mile bus ride from Steubenville, Ohio, to Moundsville, West Virginia, passed through seven time changes. Order finally came in 1966 with the enactment of the Uniform Time Act, which standardized daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October, although states had the option of remaining on standard time year-round. \n7. Not everyone in the United States springs forward and falls back. \nHawaii and Arizona\u2014with the exception of the state\u2019s Navajo Nation\u2014do not observe daylight saving time, and the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands also remain on standard time year-round. Some Amish communities also choose not to participate in daylight saving time. (Around the world, only about one-quarter of the world\u2019s population, in approximately 70 countries, observe daylight saving. Since their daylight hours don\u2019t vary much from season to season, countries closer to the equator have little need to deviate from standard time.) \n8. Evidence does not conclusively point to energy conservation as a result of daylight saving.\nDating back to Willett, daylight saving advocates have touted energy conservation as an economic benefit. A U.S. Department of Transportation study in the 1970s concluded that total electricity savings associated with daylight saving time amounted to about 1 percent in the spring and fall months. As air conditioning has become more widespread, however, more recent studies have found that cost savings on lighting are more than offset by greater cooling expenses. University of California Santa Barbara economists calculated that Indiana\u2019s move to statewide daylight saving time in 2006 led to a 1-percent rise in residential electricity use through additional demand for air conditioning on summer evenings and heating in early spring and late fall mornings. Some also argue that increased recreational activity during daylight saving results in greater gasoline consumption.","author":"Christopher  Klein","web_category":"news","title":"8 Things You May Not Know About Daylight Saving Time","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/sunrise-image.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-daylight-saving-time"}
