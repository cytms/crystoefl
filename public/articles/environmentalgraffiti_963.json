The horrible noise their claws make on the roof of a house, the evil way they sit up on their hind legs and stare at you, it all really creeps me out. It may stem from my fear of rodents in general, but every time I see a squirrel I can\u2019t help but think they\u2019re up to no good.\nNow it appears I\u2019ve been partially vindicated. A scientific study has shown that squirrels are sneaky.\nDr. Michael Steele, a researcher at Pennsylvania\u2019s Wilkes University, and several colleagues performed a study on grey squirrel behaviour. They placed acorns near squirrels and watched what the animals did with them.\nYou\u2019re probably aware that squirrels hoard their food.  What you might not have known is that squirrels don\u2019t keep all their nuts in one place, but make various holes and hiding places for their food stash. Apparently, they\u2019re also paranoid. Squirrels not only make a large number of real hiding places for their nuts, they also make fake ones. If you see a squirrel digging a hiding place, there is actually a more than 20% chance that it\u2019s a fake.\n\u201cBut Robert,\u201d you\u2019re saying, \u201cthat just proves squirrels are smart.\u201d Well, you don\u2019t know the whole story. It turns out that they do this because the other squirrels are dirty thieves.\nThe study found that squirrels are far more likely to make fake holes when they know they\u2019re being watched by other squirrels.  To the researchers, this suggests that the squirrels are aware of other squirrels intention to steal.\nSo there you have it, squirrels are deceptive when they hide their food because they know that other squirrels are thieves that are not to be trusted.\nThis article is biased, yes. But don't you have an animal you find really creepy?\nSource: AOL UK and BBC\nIf you want to find out all the latest animal news, why not subcribe to our RSS feed, we'll even throw in a free album.\n ","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Scientists Prove that Squirrels are Sneaky","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/teaserjpg_0","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/squirrels-are-sneaky/704"}
