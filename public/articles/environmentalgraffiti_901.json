Not yours!\nEveryone is happy, and when someone points out that they\u2019ll soon have a problem with lizards instead of birds, someone dismisses it by saying they\u2019ll release monkeys to eat the lizards and then cold will kill the monkeys. See, there\u2019s no real problem!\nIt\u2019s meant to be a ridiculous jab at peoples\u2019 short-sightedness, but some days it seems like reality TV. Western states have now taken steps to protect their valuable wild salmon stocks by killing sea lions. \nWashington and Oregon were both given permission to begin targeting sea lions near the Bonneville dam on the Columbia River. Oregon plans to start sea lion removal as soon as April.\nThe animals are relatively new to the area, making seasonal journeys in the past decade or so to gobble migrating salmon as they attempt to climb the dam\u2019s fish ladders. Until they cross the dam, the fish are gathered together, easy prey for a hungry sea lion.\nAuthorities have been trying to get rid of the sea lions using some amusing, but non-lethal, methods. So far they\u2019ve tried barriers, chucking firecrackers and noisemakers at them, and shooting them with rubber bullets, all to no avail.\nThe bill does have some stipulations. In order to kill a sea lion, it must first be caught and kept for 48 hours while they attempt to find a home for it at a zoo or aquarium. However, another stipulation means the wildlife officials can just go ahead and shoot sea lions that are hard to catch.\nIt was that particular insertion in the bill that angered conservationists.  \"This is a waste of money, time and lives and diverts attention from the real problems the fish face,\u201d said Sharon Young of the Humane Society of the United States.\nShe has a point. The real problem is not the sea lions, they\u2019re just following their instincts. The real problem is the dam. It hinders the fish\u2019s migration and turns them into easy prey if they can\u2019t cross easily. Naturally, instead of tackling that issue we\u2019ll be shooting sea lions instead. Homer would be proud. \n Info from Reuters\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers' choice awards.
