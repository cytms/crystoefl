Tobacco could only be visible when an adult is making a purchase or while employess are restocking. Similar restrictions were imposed in Iceland in 2001 and Canada in 2005, and these countries have seen substantial declines in youth smoking.\n?\nThe proposal, announced Monday, is the latest public-health measure brought forth by the mayor, whose ban on colossal-sized soft drinks was declared illegal by a judge last week.\n?\nCalled the Tobacco Product Display Restriction Bill, the proposal is being introduced with the hope of reducing youth smoking. \"Young people are targets of marketing and the availability of cigarettes, and this legislation will help prevent another generation from the ill-health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking,\u201d he said in a press release from the mayor's office.\n?\nHe added that the decline in kids' tobacco use has flatlined, stalling at a rate of 8.5 percent of the city\u2019s youth smoking.\n?\nPublic \"displays suggest smoking is a normal activity and invite young people to experiment with tobacco,\" he said. It would be the first law in the nation that requires retail tobacco to be concealed. A second law in the package, the Sensible Tobacco Enforcement Bill, will aim to crack down on illegal and discounted tobacco sales.\nRelated tobacco stories on MNN:\nMichael?Bloomberg's?$220M global anti-smoking crusade\nTobacco?could kill 8 million a year by 2030","author":"","web_category":"earth-matters#politics","title":"Bloomberg announces legislation to ban display of cigarettes","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/editorial/bloomberg_0.jpg","url":"http://www.mnn.com//earth-matters/politics/stories/bloomberg-announces-legislation-to-ban-display-of-cigarettes"}
