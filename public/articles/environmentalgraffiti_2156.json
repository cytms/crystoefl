Before we begin, let me write a disclaimer in an attempt to cut down on the angry emails and comments. This is not an attack on anyone\u2019s religion. I merely think that scientists who try to explain unknowable events as the result of drug use are funny. Ancient history is often as faith based as religion, with both requiring a lot of belief extrapolated from very little provable information. Most of these are just theories that even the people who created them will admit they can\u2019t prove.  So try and relax and enjoy our list of \"junkie science\" claims about biblical history.\nFor Christians, Jesus is obviously the most important man in the Bible. As such, he\u2019s gotten a lot of scrutiny, particularly of his miracles. Several scientists who set out to find a scientific explanation for these amazing events have decided they\u2019re so unbelievable the only explanation is drugs.\n4. Water Into Wine\nMy personal favourite involves the miracle of turning water into wine.  If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the story, Jesus was at a party in Cana when the wine ran out. He then transformed several large containers of water into containers of wine, and high quality wine at that. This was the first miracle performed by Jesus in the Bible.\nCalifornia ethnobotanist Clark Heinrich has a different version of the events. Heinrich believes Jesus used a psychedelic mushroom known as fly agaric. The hallucinogen was well known and used even before Biblical times, so its possible Jesus would have come across them. The really weird part of Heinrich\u2019s version of the miracle has to do with the urine of the mushroom\u2019s users. Apparently, the hallucinogenic agent in fly agaric remains in the user\u2019s urine and can turn said urine odd colors.  Heinrich believes that the \u201cwine\u201d in the miracle was actually Jesus\u2019 intoxicating urine.\n3. The Last Supper\nHeinrich also believes the fly agaric figured in the last supper.  The mushroom looks like pita bread and feels like human skin when it is soaked in water. He thinks Jesus actually passed around soaked fly agaric at the last supper when he said \u201cThis is my body\u201d.\n(Heinrich\u2019s beliefs on the matter should probably be taken with a grain of salt. He thinks that pretty much every religion and most of the famous religious events of history were in some way related to the fly agaric mushroom. While many religions are known to have used various drugs in ceremonies, it's not thought this specific mushroom was always used.)\n2. Healing Miracles from Marijuana\nA different study of biblical texts has suggested that Jesus used cannabis, and that the drug may have played a part in his healing miracles. Jesus and his disciples used an anointing oil that contained an ingredient called kaneh-bosem. Scholars believe this is a type of marijuana extract. It\u2019s believed that people were covered with this anointing oil, which could have healed eye or skin problems in a seemingly miraculous manner.\nThere is strong evidence for cannabis use in early Judaism according to Boston University classics professor Carl Ruck, so it\u2019s not so crazy to think it might have been in oil.\n1.  Was Moses Stoned When He Compiled the 10 Commandments?\nThe most recent hypothesized biblical drug event comes from Israel.  Benny Shanon of Jerusalem's Hebrew University believes that Moses and the Israelites were hallucinating during Moses\u2019 famed visit to the top of Mt. Sinai. The drug ayahuasca has been used in religious ceremonies in South America for centuries and is known to produce spiritual visions and aural hallucinations. Two plants in the Sinai desert contain the same psychoactive molecules as ayahuasca.\nThe bark of the acacia tree contains these psychoactive molecules, and is frequently mentioned as an ingredient in concoctions in the bible. Shanon, who has dabbled in psychedelic drugs himself, believes that the trumpets, thunder, and lightning described in the scriptures are similar to the profound spiritual feelings and light and sound hallucination created by ayahuasca. Essentially, he\u2019s saying the 10 commandments were created and handed down to the Israelites in a drug induced haze. I don\u2019t know about you, but I find that pretty impressive. I\u2019ve seen some people on hallucinogens and it\u2019s all they can do to stand upright, much less lay down the most important ethical tenets in Western history.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers choice awards.
