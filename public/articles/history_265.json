Like Titanic, Titan is \u201cconsidered practically unsinkable.\u201d Like Titanic, it carries too few lifeboats to accommodate all of its passengers","advice_category":"1","content":"\nThe Fictional Titan\nTitanic inspired numerous literary works shortly after its sinking, from critically acclaimed poetry to bestselling narratives by survivors. Remarkably, however, the first written account of Titanic\u2019s demise predates the disaster by 14 years. In 1898 American novelist and former sailor Morgan Robertson published \u201cFutility\u201d (later titled \u201cThe Wreck of the Titan\u201d), a maritime adventure story set on the imaginary ocean liner Titan. Anyone remotely familiar with the Titanic tragedy will surely recognize the similarities between the famous ship and Robertson\u2019s creation even in the book\u2019s opening lines: \u201cShe was the largest craft afloat and the greatest of the works of men. In her construction and maintenance were involved every science, professional and trade known to civilization.\u201d\nThe eerie coincidences multiply as Robertson\u2019s tale continues. Like Titanic, Titan is \u201cconsidered practically unsinkable.\u201d Like Titanic, it carries too few lifeboats to accommodate all of its passengers. And like Titanic, it plunges to the bottom of the North Atlantic after striking an iceberg while cruising at a rapid clip during its maiden voyage\u2014on an April night, no less. The stories diverge in places, of course, with only 13 people outliving Titan\u2019s destruction compared to 710 Titanic survivors. (And as far as we know, the real-life events never involved a drunken antihero who fell onto the offending iceberg clutching his ex-lover\u2019s child, whom he then rescued from a polar bear and kept alive until help finally came.) Still, right after Titanic sank, the fictional account rang true enough for Robertson\u2019s publisher to release a 1912 edition of the novella, capitalizing on the public\u2019s fascination with the catastrophe.\nTitanic at Coney Island\nJust two years after Titanic sank, a new and popular attraction was unveiled at New York\u2019s Coney Island. Visitors to the legendary thrill center gathered to watch miniature models of Titanic and its rescue ship, Carpathia, enact the tragic events of April 1912. A poster for the show depicted the lost ocean liner foundering in the water, an iceberg swallowing its stern and passengers falling to their deaths as lifeboats row away.\nWhile today\u2019s audiences might cringe at such a macabre spectacle opening \u201ctoo soon\u201d (or ever), it was right in line with Coney Island\u2019s other offerings in the early 20th century. In addition to Titanic\u2019s sinking, attractions recreated the devastating Galveston flood, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and a Boer War battle, among other catastrophic events. Steps away from these performances, sightseers could glimpse premature babies in incubators, African tribesmen in grass huts and a town inhabited by people with dwarfism.\nThe First Titanic Movie\nEighty-five years before James Cameron\u2019s blockbuster \u201cTitanic\u201d swept the planet, the very first Titanic-inspired movie premiered on May 14, 1912\u2014a mere month after the ship went down. Its star and cowriter, silent film darling Dorothy Gibson, had escaped the stricken vessel with her mother on lifeboat number 7, the first to be launched. Arriving in New York days later, Gibson and her lover, the producer Jules Brulatour, began crafting \u201cSaved From the Titanic,\u201d a 10-minute short intercut with newsreel footage. While filming on a freighter in New York Harbor, Gibson wore the same evening dress, sweater, coat and heels in which she\u2019d fled Titanic and boarded Carpathia on April 15.\nAudiences hungry for details about the epic disaster flocked to screenings in the United States and abroad, but not all critics lauded the swift exploitation of so recent a tragedy. A reviewer for the New York Dramatic Mirror, for instance, called it \u201crevolting, especially at this time when the horrors of the event are so fresh in mind.\u201d Despite her movie\u2019s box office success, Gibson left show business soon after its release, still traumatized, perhaps, by her ordeal. Just 23 at the time, she went on to live a life punctuated by misfortunes, including an ill-fated marriage to Brulatour, a hit-and-run accident in which she killed a pedestrian and imprisonment in a German prison camp during World War II. \u201cSaved From the Titanic,\u201d meanwhile, met an untimely end when a 1914 blaze destroyed the only prints of the film.\nTitanic Tunes\nC?line Dion\u2019s \u201cMy Heart Will Go On\u201d wasn\u2019t the only hit song that would never have topped the charts\u2014let alone existed\u2014had Titanic docked safely in New York. The sinking\u2019s aftermath saw a flurry of original compositions commemorating the calamity, from the mournful \u201cMy Sweetheart Went Down With the Ship\u201d to the rousing \u201cBe British!\u201d (a reference to the alleged final order of Titanic\u2019s captain, Edward Smith). Many songs honored Titanic\u2019s band members, who reportedly continued to play as the ship sank and lost their lives in the disaster. Another popular tune, \u201cA Hero Went Down With the Monarch of the Sea,\u201d sang the praises of a prominent victim: John Jacob Astor IV, Titanic\u2019s wealthiest passenger.\nBack then, music publishers did a brisk trade in sheet music for voice and piano, and Titanic provided a boon to business. Typically highly sentimental in nature, the songs inspired by the tragedy would have been performed in music halls, drawing rooms and other venues both public and private. Perhaps along with the music, dancers reportedly evoked the sinking by performing a \u201cTitanic two-step.\u201d\nTitanic Teddy Bears\nAs the world reeled from the news of Titanic\u2019s loss, manufacturers capitalized on the frenzy by issuing commemorative tokens ranging from postcards and plates to candy boxes and whiskey jiggers. Among the most rare Titanic-inspired collectibles were 500 commemorative teddy bears made by the German toy company Steiff. Known as \u201cmourning bears,\u201d they were stitched in black mohair and featured red-rimmed eyes to express sympathy for the victims.\nToday the limited-edition stuffed animals fetch upwards of $20,000 in elite auction houses around the world. Now, 100 years after the toys made their sad debut, Titanic\u2019s approaching centennial has ushered in a new wave of memorabilia, including music boxes, jewelry, desk diaries, full sets of china and, of course, anniversary versions of the Steiff mourning bears costing far less than their centenarian counterparts.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Titanic Mania, 1912 Style","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/titanic-coney-island.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/titanic-mania-1912-style"}
