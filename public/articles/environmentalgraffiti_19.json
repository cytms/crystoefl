Luis Gutierrez HerediaPhronima Amphipod\nThere are countless more life forms on Earth than are known to mankind, and many of these are microorganisms found in the world\u2019s oceans. Far from being dull and boring, these tiny organisms can be full of dazzling color or have scary faces, like some of the creatures shown here. Planet Magazine brings you a slideshow of newly discovered species \u2013 phytoplankton and zooplankton that may be bottom of the briny food chain, but which play an integral part in regulating the planet\u2019s climate. \nPhoto: ? Daniel BaileyCopepod\nSadly, such organisms are disappearing before we can even get to know them all \u2013 at a rate of 1% a year, thanks to climate change. The Tara Oceans Project, a research initiative involving a 118-foot schooner and a crew of researchers, has taken on the task of discovering and collecting these fascinating life forms. The team has just completed a two-and-a-half year trip through many of the world\u2019s oceans, and you can see more amazing images of these never-before-seen microorganisms in this stunning slideshow.\nPhoto: ? Daniel BaileyPolychaeta\nAmazingly, the journey just completed is just the tip of the iceberg. As Planet Magazine explains, \"The ten-year process to analyze the samples is now in its beginning stages, while future missions by Tara Expeditions are being planned. Next year, the crew will visit the Arctic to create a new inventory of biodiversity there, and in 2014 they\u2019ll head to the Pacific Ocean to study coral reefs, including visits to South Asia, which the recent voyage failed to reach.\" ","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"nature","title":"Amazing Newly Discovered Microorganisms from Our Oceans","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/e1809d8c9e927409632f4e657521202fjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/nature/news-new-unknown-microorganisms-worlds-oceans"}
