Historical and archaeological records have helped establish a relative sequence of rulers and events, known as a \u201cfloating chronology,\u201d but anchoring them to specific years has been an imprecise and contentious process. Some of the most accurate predictions come from textual references to astronomical events such as eclipses, which scientists can trace back to a specific moment in time. Traditional radiocarbon dating of mummies and other remains, on the other hand, has only yielded rough estimates due to its error ranges of 100 to 200 years.\nTo nail down a more precise chronology, a team of researchers led by Christopher Bronk Ramsey of the University of Oxford has turned to an unlikely source: plants. They combed through museum collections in Europe and the United States\u2014export of antiquities is prohibited in Egypt\u2014and looked for organic materials such as seeds, baskets, textiles, papyri, stems and fruits. After amassing 211 samples, some as tiny as a grain of wheat and more than 4,500 years old, they used radiocarbon techniques to date each one.\nThe results allowed them to estimate new dates for 37 pharaohs, including King Tut, Ramses II and Hatshepsut. For example, the team gathered seeds and plant materials from King Tut\u2019s tomb and measured their carbon-14 levels. From the age of the samples, the researchers concluded that Tutankhamen\u2019s reign occurred roughly a decade earlier than previously thought\u2014between 1353 and 1331 B.C.\nThe study revises a number of other key dates and irons out a few of the inconsistencies that have befuddled historians and kindled heated debates. For the most part, however, it suggests that the widely accepted chronology of Egypt\u2019s Old, Middle and New Kingdoms is largely accurate, which means Egyptologists around the world can breathe a collective sigh of relief.
