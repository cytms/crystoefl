It lived roughly 125 million years ago, 60 million years before the more advanced tyrannosauroid T. rex. While Yutyrannus shares some features with its famous cousin, it still has the three-fingered forelimbs and primitive theropod foot of other early tyrannosauroids.\nYutyrannus\u2019 coat consisted of simple filaments that would have made this Cretaceous giant surprisingly soft to the touch, said lead author Xu Xing of Beijing\u2019s Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. \u201cThey were more like the fuzzy down of a modern baby chick than the stiff plumes of an adult bird,\u201d he explained.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, Yutyrannus weighed 40 times more than Beipiaosaurus, the largest previously known feathered dinosaur. \u201cYutyrannus dramatically increases the size range of dinosaurs for which we have definite evidence of feathers,\u201d said Xu. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that feathers were much more widespread, at least among the meat-eating dinosaurs, than most scientists would have guessed even a few years ago.\u201d Indeed, scientists have yet to rule out the possibility that T. rex had plumage, at least over parts of its anatomy.\nWith its robust size and downy fluff, Yutyrannus wouldn\u2019t have used its feathers for flight in the manner of today\u2019s living theropods (birds). Corwin Sullivan, a Canadian paleontologist involved in the Nature study, said the enigmatic dinosaur might have relied on its quills for insulation. \u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201clarge-bodied animals typically can retain heat quite easily, and actually have more of a potential problem with overheating. That makes Yutyrannus, which is large and downright shaggy, a bit of a surprise.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"T.
