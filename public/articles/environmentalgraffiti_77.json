They may look cute but they are massive and can be dangerous to dive with, as Steve Backshall, presenter of BBC Earth's Deadly 60 series, discovered.\nPhoto: Emma Jones/BBCEarth\nWith each individual being as big as a car, the only predators of Steller sea lions are killer whales and sharks. Apart from the fact that they hunt in groups, they have a reputation for playing with divers to scare them away. This was one dive where the team got out of the water as soon as they were done filming: it was too risky to stay in longer.\nPhoto: Emma Jones/BBCEarth\nDeadly 60 director James had this to say: \"As filming went on it became more and more intimidating; one sea lion would distract you, blowing bubbles in your face, while another grabbed your fins from behind and gave them a good yank. At one point, a young male hovered above Steve in his blind spot and fastened a mouth the size of a lion\u2019s on to the top of his head.\n\u201cI had a nightmare premonition of it biting through his skull, but it seemed to have had enough sport and shot off.
