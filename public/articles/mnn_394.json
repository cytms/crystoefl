With the white training pod attached, it resembles a sideways exclamation point.\n?\n\u201cIt\u2019s one great exclamation point in the story of Earth\u2019s exploration,\u201d said Dave Gallo, president of WHOI. Gallo emphasized that the Deepsea Challenger expedition was not just about exploration, but also about understanding humanity\u2019s relationship with the oceans.\n?\n\u201cThe trick is that you can love this planet to death,\u201d Gallo said. \u201cYou can have unintended consequences thinking you\u2019re doing the right thing but really making a decision that may have severe consequences. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to base decisions on real fact, not just on emotion. Fact means getting out and actually observing, and to begin that you\u2019ve got to explore.\"\n?\nWhat we have explored amounts to about 5 percent of the entire ocean \u2014 which means we understand even less than that, said Gallo.\n?\nYet the deepest parts of the ocean may hold the clues to some of life\u2019s biggest mysteries. Christina Symons, geologist and science outreach coordinator for the expedition, said that the discovery of thriving bacteria at the bottom of the Mariana Trench has implications for life on our planet and others.\n?\nSymons was present during the historic 6.8-mile voyage to the bottom of the ocean.\n?\n\u201cI felt like it was landing on the moon,\u201d she said. Cameron\u2019s radio communications came through now and then as he ticked off depths until he reached the bottom \u2014?just like in mission control.\n?\nVideo from the dive has identified two new sea cucumber species, a creature not previously thought to survive at such depths and pressure, along with new arthropod species and more than 60 new bacterial species \u2014 at least so far.?\n?\n\u201cWe could send a robot, but there\u2019s value to sending people to the bottom because when James Cameron goes there and we can see it through his eyes and share it through his experiences, then that\u2019s a whole new dimension of meaning,\u201d said Dove, who has blogged about the mission on Deep Sea News.\n?\nAside from significant gains for marine biology, the sub is a veritable engineering feat.\n?\n\u201cThe challenges they had to overcome to do that were every bit as difficult as what NASA has had to overcome to go to space,\u201d said Dove. \u201cIt\u2019s really an extraordinary human and engineering endeavor.\u201d\n?\nIt\u2019s exactly the solutions to those challenges that the team at WHOI will examine when the Deepsea Challenger arrives.\n?\n\"We\u2019re going to have a series of meetings to understand how we can learn from what they did here, and how we can do things together in the future,\u201d Gallo said. \u201cIt is just the beginning of a long relationship.\"\n?\nThe sub\u2019s visit took place just two days before World Oceans Day (June 8), which Georgia Aquarium plans to celebrate all weekend long with one major theme: that we have the power to protect.\n?\n\u201cBaba Dioum said we\u2019re only going to protect what we love, and we\u2019re only going to love what we understand,\u201d Dove said. \u201cI would add that we\u2019re only going to love what we\u2019ve explored.? Something like the Deepsea Challenger allows us to explore the oceans, understand them better, and that motivates us to protect them.\u201d\n?\n?\nRelated on MNN:\nEerie images from Cameron's deep sea dive\nNew deep sea species found in Antarctica\n8 bizarre newly discovered deep sea creatures","author":"","web_category":"earth-matters#wilderness-resources","title":"Deepsea Challenger makes stop at Georgia Aquarium","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/editorial/DeepSeaChallengerFeature.jpg","url":"http://www.mnn.com//earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/deepsea-challenger-makes-stop-at-georgia-aquarium"}
