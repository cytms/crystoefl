Jackson, Virginia\u2019s nominee for lieutenant governor, it\u2019s the yoga mat and Lululemon pants we should be fearing.\nJackson is pulling double-duty as the pastor of Exodus Faith Ministries and as the Virginia Republican party\u2019s nominee for lieutenant governor. He has some mighty strong opinions, and his quotes are creating a virtual field day for the media.\nBehold this?nugget:?\u201cLiberalism and their ideas have done more to kill black folks whom they claim so much to love than the Ku Klux Klan, lynching and slavery and Jim Crow ever did, now that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\nOr this gem on gays: \u201cTheir minds are perverted, they\u2019re frankly very sick people psychologically, mentally and emotionally.\u201d\nWhich is to say, he may be a pastor and a politician, but he\u2019s certainly no diplomat. And while his outspoken attacks on liberalism, gay rights, Obama, and pro-choice have caused plenty of jaw dropping, his warnings to the yoga set are causing more amused head-scratching than outrage.\nAs The National Review reports, in his 2008 book,?\u201cTen Commandments to an Extraordinary Life: Making Your Dreams Come True,\u201d Jackson warns that yoga and meditation create an open door for the devil to move in and make himself at home.\n\u201cWhen one hears the word meditation, it conjures an image of Maharishi Yoga [sic] talking about finding a mantra and striving for nirvana...\" he writes. \"The purpose of such meditation is to empty oneself... [Satan] is happy to invade the empty vacuum of your soul and possess it. That is why people serve Satan without ever knowing it or deciding to, but no one can be a child of God without making a decision to surrender to him. Beware of systems of spirituality which tell you to empty yourself. You will end up filled with something you probably do not want.\u201d\nWell alrighty then.\nIt seems that given all the research showing the benefits of meditation ?\u2014 from heart health and pain relief to cognitive improvement and stress relief \u2014 it might be a deal with the devil worth making.\nRelated stories on MNN:\n7 recent failed doomsday predictions?\nWestboro Baptist Church overwhelmed at coal mine protest","author":"","web_category":"earth-matters#politics","title":"Satan possesses those who practice yoga, says Virginia politico","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/editorial/E.W.%20Jackson.jpg","url":"http://www.mnn.com//earth-matters/politics/stories/satan-possesses-those-who-practice-yoga-says-virginia-politico"}
