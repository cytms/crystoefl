Published in the September issue of the African Journal of Ecology, the report by Tim Caro and Paul Scholte states that: \u201cFor years, wildlife managers and biologists in Africa have known that large mammals were disappearing outside reserves.\n[Now]\u2026we are losing species from many of Africa\u2019s national parks.\u201d\n\nIncreased pressures on reserves\u2019 ecosystems have resulted in a decline in the number of large mammals. Africa\u2019s growing population requires more resources, putting the future of parks in jeopardy as the need to cultivate or build on land grows.  Some park areas were already occupied by farming communities.  \nThe ecologists looked at antelope populations and found that many parks are subject to the illegal hunting: \u201cBushmeat hunting is often the most common factor pressing upon antelope populations. In the old days, this was for local consumption, now it includes tables in far-off cities that, incredibly, extend to London and Paris.\u201d\nThe article concludes that we may have to revise our ideas of wildlife conservation to match our rapidly changing world.  The old idea of setting aside large tracts of land in remote areas far from human populations is still a viable option in some parts of the continent \u2026but it is a conservation approach increasingly outmoded by land use change, demographics and policy reform.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the new data shows, however, is even relatively well-organized protected areas cannot be relied on as long-lasting conservation tools\u2026In the final analysis, we may have to get used to faunal relaxation in Africa\u2019s network of famous reserves leaving a continent containing isolated pockets of large mammal diversity living at low population sizes. Just like Europe.\u201d\nSources include: African Journal of Ecology\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.
