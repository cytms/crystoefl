The birth marks the first time reintroduced gorillas have had a baby in the wild in Gabon.\nOkeli\u2019s parents Marco and Lekedi were both orphans.

This would mean the gorillas had been smuggled into Nigeria by poachers.\nThe gorillas\u2019 plight has become a cause celebre. Many people felt the gorillas should be returned to the wild rather than face the rest of their life in a zoo.  Red-faced Malaysian authorities sent the animals to a South African zoo in 2004.
