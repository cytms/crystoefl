For reasons that neither John Baur nor Mark Summers can precisely recall, they began trading insults and encouragements in the lingo, tone and syntax of stereotypical pirates. \u201cArrr!\u201d one exclaimed. \u201cThat be a fine cannonade!\u201d the other hollered. Lapsing into swashbuckler slang proved so addictive that the two friends decided a new holiday should be devoted to the activity.\nFor the next seven years, the men celebrated Talk Like a Pirate Day as something of an inside joke, choosing the birthday of Summers\u2019 ex-wife as the obvious date for its observance. But in 2002, they shared their idea with the syndicated humor writer David Barry, who promoted it in a tongue-in-cheek column that described Baur and Summers as \u201cvisionary individuals.\u201d The holiday went viral, and now landlubbers across the globe spend September 19 shouting \u201cAhoy!\u201d to their mateys, pouring noggins of rum and denouncing lily-livered scallywags.\nPirate Talk: Myth Versus Reality\nSince the 19th century, books, plays, films and cartoons have depicted pirates who brandish colorful vocabularies and lay on thick accents with distinctive lingering \u201cr\u201d sounds. But did the swashbucklers of yore really shout \u201cArrr!\u201d and speak a language all their own? While Anglophone sailors during the so-called \u201cgolden age of piracy\u201d\u2014the era in the 17th and 18th centuries when rogue privateers prowled the seas for plunder\u2014certainly shared a common vernacular, stereotypical pirate talk combines actual nautical terms with fictionalized clich?s. In other words, chances are that Bartholomew Roberts, the Welsh pirate who is said to have inspired Disney\u2019s Captain Jack Sparrow, didn\u2019t sound a whole lot like Johnny Depp in \u201cPirates of the Caribbean.\u201d\nMuch of what we know about Blackbeard, Calico Jack, Anne Bonny and other infamous pirates comes from \u201cA General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates,\u201d a 1724 collection of sea rover biographies. The volume inspired the popular pirate tales of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s \u201cTreasure Island\u201d and J.M. Barrie\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Stevenson in particular invented new turns of phrase and resurrected obscure nautical jargon, creating what many consider a seminal pirate-speak text. He wrote the now-famous pirate anthem \u201cFifteen Men on the Dead Man\u2019s Chest\u201d (featuring the lyric \u201cYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d) in the style of the traditional sailors\u2019 work songs known as sea shanties.\nFor other iconic expressions as well as the snarling brogue of onscreen pirates, the world can thank Robert Newton, described by the founders of International Talk Like a Pirate Day as its patron saint. Newton portrayed Long John Silver in Disney\u2019s 1950 film \u201cTreasure Island,\u201d later reprising the role in a sequel and television series. The British character actor concocted many of the wild-eyed, lurching mannerisms associated with villainous buccaneers and based his vocal style on the \u201cr\u201d-rolling West Country accent of his native Cornwall\u2014a choice that may approach historical accuracy, since many marauders during piracy\u2019s heyday hailed from southwest England. Newton peppered his speech with the archetypal pirate cry \u201cArrr!\u201d that has punctuated buccaneer dialogue ever since.\nPirate Glossary\nGet into the spirit of International Talk Like a Pirate Day by slipping one of these terms into conversation today.\nShiver me timbers: Commonly associated with pirates, this exclamation is thought to have first appeared in \u201cJacob Faithful,\u201d an 1834 novel by Frederick Marryat about a London boy\u2019s life on a riverboat. (It was originally written as \u201cShiver my timbers,\u201d the \u201cme\u201d having been swapped in later to echo certain British regional dialects.) Robert Louis Stevenson further popularized the phrase in \u201cTreasure Island.\u201d Although we may never know whether the expression really figured prominently in nautical slang, \u201cshiver\u201d meant \u201cbreak into pieces\u201d in Old English, while \u201ctimbers\u201d referred to a ship\u2019s support frames. So \u201cShiver me timbers!\u201d roughly translates to \u201cMay my boat fall apart!\u201d\nHearties: When seamen shouted \u201cahoy\u201d to their \u201chearties,\u201d they were greeting their mates\u2014fellow crewmembers who displayed their courage and \u201cheart\u201d on the dangerous seas. The original form of this term of endearment appears in the opening scene of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Tempest,\u201d in which a sailor shouts, \u201cHeigh, my hearts!\u201d\nDavy Jones\u2019 locker: Sailors used this idiom as a synonym for \u201cwatery grave\u201d in the 19th century. For reasons that remain unclear, Davy Jones was the name given to the evil spirit said to inhabit the depths. When seamen drowned, they went to his lair\u2014or locker\u2014at the bottom of the ocean.\nYoung puppies: Apparently, the notorious pirate Blackbeard, born Edward Teach around 1680, considered this a derogatory term. According to Robert Maynard of the Royal Navy, who ambushed and killed Blackbeard in 1718, the famous buccaneer used the insult for his enemies during battle.\nWalking the plank: It is believed that some mutineers and pirates used this form of murder or torture to punish ousted officers or captured rivals, forcing them to step off a wooden beam and into shark-filled waters. While the phrase appears in a handful of newspaper reports from the 18th and 19th centuries, pirates during that era likely enforced the legendary punishment less frequently than movies and other fictional accounts would have us believe.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"On Talk Like a Pirate Day, Landlubbers Arrr Shouting \u2018Ahoy\u2019","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/blackbeard-thumb.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/on-talk-like-a-pirate-day-landlubbers-arrr-shouting-ahoy"}
