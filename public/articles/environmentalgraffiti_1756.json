We\u2019re not entirely sure whether it also senses furniture and errant pets but if it does then it\u2019s pretty impressive.\nMartyr, the Energy Saving FundamentalistPhoto: \nThe Play Coalition\u2019s better known creation is 'Martyr', a monkey-shaped energy-saving lightbulb. The 'energy saving fundamentalist', as its creators have labelled it, is a simple visual reminder that we should be pulling all appliances out of their sockets when not in use \u2013 an environmental statement for your home as well as a conversation piece.\nUnfortunately you won't be able to find either of these creations in stores or online any time soon, however, if you absolutely love these and want to pressure their creators into making them available to the rest of us, head on over to The Play Coalition website to see these and some of their other environmentally-savvy designs.\nSource: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
