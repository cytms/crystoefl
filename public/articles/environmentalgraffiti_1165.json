Whether it's cycling down the coast of California or sailing in the clear blue waters off North Carolina, the desire to go out and try something new burns strong, but if it isn't our personal circumstances that get in the way, it's financial constraints.\nWhatever it is that floats your boat \u2013 from kayaking and kite boarding to wine tasting and whale watching \u2013 San Fransisco-based company zozi says its aim is to make your activity of choice more affordable.

There are more out-of-the-ordinary and adventurous things to be getting up to \u2013 some of them truly off the beaten track. And TJ for one is keen to \"encourage people to get out there and explore.\u201d\t\nPhoto: Rollx\nzozi is planning to continue its expansion into new cities and regions, and those who sign\u2010up at zozi.com will receive regular emails highlighting what's happening locally.
