As knee-high boots are a go-to for many women, a colorful tall sock can be a easy (and cozy) way to bring some fun to drab winter colors. \n \n\nThis graphic orange and blue pair of handcrafted over-the-knee socks are made on an antique knitting machine.\n \n\nThis cute Swiss-style sock works with shorter boots (as shown here) or with knee-highs. These are made from cotton, so if you want a lighter sock, these are the ticket.  \n \n\nIf you want the look of a boot sock, but not the bulk or the warmth for your feet (or if your boots are too small for thick socks), boot cuffs are a great way to get the look and keep your legs warm. \n \n\nThese cute Norwegian-style socks look as cute with your boots on as off. Handknit from stretchy grey and cream wool yarns, these are perfect for holidays and beyond. \n \n\nThese hand-dyed burgundy socks are the perfect color to dress up an all-black outfit, or add some cheer to a pair of boots slushing through the snow or mud. ","web_category":"lifestyle#natural-beauty-fashion","advice_category":"5","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/bootcuffsmn.jpg","title":"Vintage Fridays: Boot socks","author":""}
