Are you ready to give the \"green\" lifestyle a try? The national nonprofit Teens Turning Green would like to help you get started with its Project Green Challenge, which is set to launch on Oct. 1.  \n\n\t \n\n\tProject Green Challenge 2012 is a global call to action for high school and college students to transition from a conventional lifestyle to a greener one. To inspire action, Teens Turning Green will sponsor 30 green challenges in the categories of body, food, labeling, paper, fair trade, etc. over the course of 30 days. Participants will be awarded points based on whether or not they completed the challenge. The top 20 daily submissions will also receive prizes.\n\n\t \n\n\tAnd that's not all. After the 30-day Challenge, Teens Turning Green will select 12 finalists who will be flown to San Francisco for Green University, a three-day eco-summit from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2, where according to the website, these young leaders \"will have the opportunity to work with and learn from each other and an esteemed group of eco-heroes in a spectacular weekend of sharing, education, inspiration, and creation of platforms for social change.\"\n\n\t \n\n\tSurf on over to learn more about Project Green Challenge and sign up to go green.\n\n\t \n\n\tRelated green living story on MNN: 9 bloggers' yearlong green journeys [Photo gallery]\n\n\t ","web_category":"lifestyle#responsible-living","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/college%20students_0.jpg","title":"Teens Turning Green launches Project Green Challenge","author":""}
