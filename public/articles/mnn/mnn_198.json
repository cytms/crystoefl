Wilson created the Change.org petition after his students discussed the environmental impact of discarded plastic.\n\n\t \n\n\tIn his petition, Wilson writes: \n\n\t \n\n\t\"Every year, Crayola makes about half a billion markers -- enough markers to wrap around the earth more than three times! -- and sells them all around the world. Millions of kids use and love Crayola products -- including the students at Sun Valley School, where I volunteer. That's why we're asking Crayola to make sure these markers don't end up in our landfills, incinerators and oceans.\"\n\n\t \n\n\tThe petition asks Crayola executives to give consumers a convenient way to recycle the millions of Crayola markers manufactured every year. Wilson says the kids are hopeful Crayola will make its current recycling program — an internal program that includes only markers malformed during production — available to all consumers. They are petitioning Crayola to create a “take-back” program that would allow consumers to easily recycle plastic markers.\n\n\t \n\n\tIn just one week, thousands of people have signed on to the campaign.\n\n\t \n\n\tAlso on MNN: 10 off-the-radar recyclers\n\n\t ","web_category":"lifestyle#recycling","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/markers.jpg","title":"Calif. kids petition Crayola to take back markers","author":""}
