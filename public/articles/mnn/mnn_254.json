{"url":"http://www.mnn.com//lifestyle/responsible-living/blogs/on-international-womens-day-a-big-cheer-for-a-young-woman","content":" \nOur lifestyle blogger Starre has already written about International Women’s Day today with a great post on 4 ways you can help women who need it. She has some suggestions that everyone can put into practice, so you should check it out, but not before checking out this young woman, blogger Hannah, who I came across today.\n \nI am a huge fan of the Indigo Girls, and an email they sent to their fans led me to Call Me Hannah, a blog by a 10-year-old girl who has an amazing, intelligent, fun head on her shoulders. Her blog tagline is “Hey, I just met you and this is crazy. Here’s my blog, read it, maybe.”\n \nHannah has been blogging since June of last year, and she’s already had the opportunity to interview some women who have made an impression on her, including Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls. In the interview, she asks Amy some great questions about her music and the social issues that Amy fights for, including the environment.\n \n\n\n \nShe’s also interviewed Severn-Cullis Suzuki, daughter of David Suzuki, written about fair trade and how she can be more eco-friendly, and started a penny drive at her school to provide clean water for children.\n \nToday, on International Women’s Day, I want to give a big cheer for Hannah, an amazing girl who is an amazing woman in-the-making.\n \nMore women we admire here at MNN:\nSucheta Ruwal\nAlexandra Cousteau\nRobyn O’Brien","web_category":"lifestyle#responsible-living","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/call%20me%20large.jpg","title":"On International Women's Day, a big cheer for a young woman","author":""}
