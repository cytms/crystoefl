Check; interactive weather, flora and fauna? Check. Today’s Google Doodle has it all as the search engine pays homage to Earth Day with an interactive logo that “captures a slice of nature's subtle wonders,” according to doodler Leon Hong.\n \nThe first Google Doodle was created as kind of an inside-joke in 1998, an “out of office” message sent when Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin played with the corporate logo to indicate they were going to the Burning Man festival. Since then, the team of Google doodlers has created hundreds of doodles for the United States' Google site, and many more than that have been designed internationally.\n \nToday's Earth Day logo, more short film than static graphic, may be one of the most interactive yet. The search icon in the doodle leads viewers to an abundance of information about Earth Day, while clicking around the doodle allows visitors to bring forth rain and snow from clouds, make animals appear and disappear, grow trees and even make a wish on a dandelion.\n \n\"We hope you enjoy discovering animals, controlling the weather, and observing the seasons,\" notes Hong. Google has even posted the checklist below to ensure that nothing is missed.\n\nAlternatively, you can just sit back and watch as the days and seasons hypnotically pass by, and revel in the beauty of this orb we call home. \n \nRelated Earth Day stories on MNN:\n18 surprising facts about Earth Day\nEarth Day: An animated tribute\nEarth Day photos: Celebrating the beauty of our planet","web_category":"green-tech#computers","advice_category":"3","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/editorial/google%20doodle.png","title":"Google Doodle for Earth Day is an interactive delight","author":""}
