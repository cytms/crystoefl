It's the triumphant tale of fulfilled dreams, newfound dignity and old-fashioned pluck arising from a close-knit community where daily realities include drug-related violence, destitution, and mountains of \"rotting detritus.\" And during a month that's been marked by some truly horrific events, I can't imagine a better project to help bring to life. This, folks, is humanity at its best. \n \nRelated in MNN: 7 examples of living furniture","web_category":"lifestyle#recycling","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"","title":"Kickstarter campaign aims to bring 'Landfill Harmonic' to the big screen","author":""}
