But the wee PC that costs a mere $25 or $35 has also ignited a world of creativity as the tech set devises increasingly fun and clever ways to employ the credit-card sized computer. Here are some of our favorites.\n1. Make a spider robot (because good old creepy-crawling live spiders aren’t terrifying enough).\n \n\n\n \n2. Make a kooky, cocktail-dispensing robot.\n \n\n \n3. Build a retro computer.\n \n\n\n \n4. Bring R2D2 to life; never be lonely again.\n \n\n\n \n5. Make a dynamic, bike-light projector.\n \n\n\n \n6. Build a keyboard with 40 beer cans. (Procuring the materials is half the fun.)\n \n\n\n \n7. Build a one-button audiobook player.\n \n\n\n \n8. Use as the payload of a weather balloon, because launching things into space is fun.\n \n\n\n \n9. Get back to your roots, make a beatbox using … beets.\n \n\n\n \n10. Combine with Legos to build a supercomputer, conquer the world.\n \n\n\n \nRelated on MNN: 14 best DIY gadget projects\n ","web_category":"green-tech#computers","advice_category":"3","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/editorial/beet%20box.jpg","title":"10 clever uses for a Raspberry Pi","author":""}
