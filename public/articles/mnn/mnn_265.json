Nominate them for an award from Do Something and they could win $100,000!\n \nHere's how it works. Take a look at some of the previous Do Something Award winners — folks like Jackie Rotman of California who founded Everybody Dance Now! to provide free dance programs to youth who could not otherwise afford them or Brandon Odums of Louisiana whose organization, 2-Cent, produces webisodes and short documentaries that use humor and attitude to tackle serious topics like race, poverty and sex.  \n \nNext, look over the judging criteria to see if your organization fits the bill. If so, fill out an application — or nominate someone you think deserves it — and you could be on your way to winning $100,000 for your cause. Finalists will be flown to New York in June for face-to-face interviews with the selection committee, and the grand prize winner will be announced at the Do Something's Award shown in August on Vh1.  \n \nApplicants must be 25 or younger (born on or after 9/1/87) and be a U.S. or Canadian citizen or permanent resident.\n \nThe deadline to apply is April 15, 2013 by 5 p.m. EST.\n \nRelated post on MNN: 19 super kids who will save the world","web_category":"lifestyle#responsible-living","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/Do%20Something%20collage.jpg","title":"Under 25 and changing the world?
