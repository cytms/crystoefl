These T-shirts are made from an entirely traceable supply chain in North Carolina by TS Designs in Burlington. \n\tAll T-shirts are made of 100 percent North Carolina-grown, super-soft ringspun cotton, are certified “dirt to shirt,” and every shirt has a code that the wearer can use to see every member of the supply chain that made his or her product.\n\tAll graphics are created from water-based inks.\n\tT-shirt design inspired by Experimental Jetset.\n\t100 percent of proceeds go to the Clean Clothes Campaign to help with continued coverage and monitoring of working conditions in the global garment industry. \n\t$30 (U.S. shipping only!); You can buy one here. ","web_category":"lifestyle#natural-beauty-fashion","advice_category":"5","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/stopfastfashion3MNN.jpg","title":"A T-shirt that proves clothing manufacture can be eco- and people-friendly","author":""}
