This was the original economy -- the sharing economy.\n\n\t \n\n\tYou've probably heard the term recently for good reason.. it is making a big comeback. The advent of digital technology to help facilitate these non-monetized transactions along with a whoop-ass recession has led many to seek a return to the sharing economy. New companies like HipSwap (essentially an online swap meet) and Zotwheels, AirBnB or Uniiverse, are taking the world by storm -- offering a new way for people to share and \"profit\" from their old stuff. \n\n\t \n\n\tThat's why the folks at TriplePundit are launching a crowd-funded project to document the rise of this new parallel economy.

TriplePundit wants to document this exciting movement and so to make things interesting they issued a challenge to the members of their community to fund it.\n\n\t.\n\n\t\tFor us, it’s a litmus test of how popular this idea of the sharing economy really is, as well as its potential. We’ll make this series as big as our supporters want us to.\n\n\n\t.\n\n\tLearn more about the sharing economy and how you can support this cool project. \n\n\t ","web_category":"lifestyle#responsible-living","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/sharing-economy-swap-vanderbilt-U.jpg","title":"The rise of the sharing economy","author":""}
