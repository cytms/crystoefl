While it's not yet the norm, there are a number of towns and cities throughout the U.S. that have initiated bag bans over the past several years. In 2007, San Francisco enacted the first plastic bag ban which was quickly followed by bans in Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Aspen, Hawaii and North Carolina's Outer Banks. And the U.S. isn't alone on this issue. From Italy to Togo, there are a number of cities and countries that have banned the use of plastic bags outright.\n\n\t \n\n\tThis nifty little interactive map came across my desk recently. and I thought it was worth sharing as it gives info at a glance about which cities and countries have already banned plastic bags, which have tried and failed, and which are using other methods to deter their use.
