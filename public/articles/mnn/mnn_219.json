{"url":"http://www.mnn.com//lifestyle/recycling/blogs/1000-doors-push-pull-repurpose","content":"Some green design eye candy for you on this chilly Tuesday morning via the South Korean capital city of Seoul where recycle-happy installation artist and designer Choi Jeong-Hwa has worked some true magic with discarded building materials.\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\tFor the transformative, rubberneck-inducing 2009 project simply titled “千 Doors,” Choi completely plastered the façade of an unremarkable 10-story commercial building with 1,000 discarded doors. This was a slight departure for an acclaimed artist best known for \"elevating dumpster diving to high art,\" as the Creators Project puts it. Normally, Choi works not with repurposed building materials but with found plastic objects and straight-up garbage as evidenced in his 2008 installation \"Gather Together.\" For this undertaking, he festooned Jamsil Stadium, a massive structure built for the 1988 Summer Olympics, with sparkling strings of trash unceremoniously thrown away by 10 million people. \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\tAs you can see from the photos above and below, with the help of a vivid imagination, scaffolding, and some dedicated scavanging, Choi was able to turn the humdrum and the neglected into somewhat quite extraordinary. “千 Doors\" isn't the prettiest thing in the world— a commenter over at TreeHugger likens the building to a \"slum on steroids\" — but it's certainly arresting and gets you thinking. Can you imagine turning around the corner of a busy city block and encountering this perplexing, pixelated landmark? Uhhh, can someone point me to the entrance?\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\tVia [TreeHugger]\n\n ","web_category":"lifestyle#recycling","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/1000Doors3.jpeg","title":"1,000 Doors: Push, pull, repurpose","author":""}
