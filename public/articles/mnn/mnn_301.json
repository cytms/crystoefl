A typical box might have 20 different items (in sample sizes) and is best thought of as a product discovery engine. The Conscious Box crew does a good job of picking products so you get a great spread of sustainable goods.\n\n\t \n\n\tI reviewed the Conscious box a couple of years ago (and then again earlier this year).\n\n\t \n\n\tThe folks over at Conscious Box have kindly offered three free boxes up to my readers in celebration of their one-year anniversary of being in business.\n\n\t \n\n\tSo here is how we're going to give them away: the three people who tell the best bad joke in the comment section on this post, as judged by me, will win a special first-anniversary Conscious Box.\n\n\t \n\n\tWhat is a good bad joke? Here are a few of my favorites:\n\n\t \n\n\t• Did you hear about the new pirate movie coming out? It's so violent that it's been rated Arrrrrrr…\n\n\t \n\n\t• Knock knock. Who's there? Boo. Boo who? Don't cry, it's only a joke.\n\n\t \n\n\t• (Followed immediately by:) Knock knock. Who's there? Woo. Woo who? Don't get excited, it's only a joke.\n\n\t \n\n\tThe cheesier, the better. Bring 'em bad.\n\n\t \n\n\tI will make my decision at noon Wednesday, Nov. 7, so you have until then to submit your best bad joke. Best of luck!\n\n\t \n\n\tAre you on Twitter? Follow me (@sheagunther) there, I give good tweets.
