I spent most of my life living a typical life being caught up in the endless pursuit of material possessions. I didn’t really believe possessions were the key to happiness, but you wouldn’t have guessed that by looking at my checkbook. Fortunately, I had a conversation with my neighbor that changed my life forever. She introduced me to intentionally living with less.\n \n\"We immediately cleared the clutter from our home and life. As a result, we found a valuable new way to live life centered on our most important values. It has been a journey of discovering the abundant life is actually found in owning less.”\n \nHis blog, Becoming Minimalist, has been seen on the \"CBS Evening News,\" NPR, The Guardian and other media outlets. Join us on Jan. 30 and share your experiences of living the simple life — or trying to get there.\n \nMeanwhile, please check back for more upcoming events in the Year of Living Simply.","web_category":"lifestyle#responsible-living","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/editorial/joshua-becker-speaking12.png","title":"Becoming Minimalist: Live Google+ Event","author":""}
