The study found by online job site Yes 123 found that 92 percent of the office workers surveyed think good-looking people stand a better chance of making a good impression during job interviews.\n \nDespite that, Huang Yu-ling, a spokeswoman for Yes 123, told the Central News Agency that in the fashion industry, looks might be important, but in most other professions, ability is what counts toward promotion.\n \nThe study was based on surveys of more than 1,110 Taiwanese employees.\n \n \nFollow Chad Brooks on Twitter @cbrooks76 or BusinessNewsDaily @BNDarticles.
