Specifically, printed pants (paired with patterned or plain tops). Here are four eco-fashion versions in various styles to fit almost any wardrobe — go ahead, be daring and wear the (printed) pants again. \n \n\nThe Jean Val Jean from Feral Childe is the perfect pair to try this new trend on since they are like jeans crossed with pants. Made from hemp and organic cotton (with a bit of spandex for stretch) in NYC, they offer some seriously cute eco-fashion.\n \n\nLina Rennel's fabulous pants are made in Northern California, and the pattern was dreamed up in the designer's mind. This vertical pattern is flattering and the ankle-length hem is ideal for booties, platforms or flats. \n \n \n\nThe Tam 'O Shanter pant by Edith A. Miller looks like a maxi skirt when worn, but your secret is that it's actually pants. Made in the USA. \n \n\nThe Motorcycling Leggings from Ananda Pascual are a cool and colorful way to rock the patterned pants trend. These are fairly made by marginalized Bangladeshi women, providing jobs. ","web_category":"lifestyle#natural-beauty-fashion","advice_category":"5","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/patternpants.jpg","title":"Patterned pants: A 2012 trend worth trying","author":""}
