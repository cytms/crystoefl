Do people stare at its awesomeness? ... Do you wanna get paid for having an epic beard? ... Join the world's first Beardvertising network,” reads the plea from a Kentucky-based advertising agency that is paying $5 per day to men willing to adorn their whiskers with wee billboards.\n \nThe agency, Cornett-IMS, created the \"beardvertising\" campaign for A&W Root Beer; it was designed to help bodaciously bearded men capitalize on their natural resources. (Not to mention to help a baby-boom brand find its way into the hearts of hipsters everywhere.)\n \nWhit Hiler from Cornett-IMS told Business Insider that the campaign isn't limited to Kentucky, and will be employed \"anywhere that there were epic beards willing to host these little 'beardboards.'\"\n \nAnd apparently, men with exuberant facial fur are game. Hiler said, \"We're getting a ton of emails from guys with epic beards that want to host beardboards and we're actually in talks with some brands that want to be Beardvertisers. I think we'll probably be seeing some beardboards in the wild before too long.\"\n \nWill the unruly manes of Williamsburg and Portland become fruitful ground for advertisers? Will there be a beard backlash? Will the beardboards be resilient enough to resist bacon grease and Pabst Blue Ribbon stains?\n \nOnly time will tell, but the agency is feeling confident. \"I think it's the next big thing,\" Hiler said. \"Everybody loves beards.\"\n \nRelated stories on MNN:\n\n5 health benefits of beards\nMustaches defy gravity at facial hair competition\nMustache transplants are the new big thing\n\n ","web_category":"lifestyle#natural-beauty-fashion","advice_category":"5","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/editorial/beardboard.jpg","title":"Beards become the latest turf for ads","author":""}
