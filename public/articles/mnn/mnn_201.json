Waste facility and landfill operators hate them because of their size, bulk and resistance to compression. The vast majority of those millions of trashed mattresses end up choking landfills, locking away the valuable resources found in even the grimmest used mattress. Where most of us might see a problem, some resourceful people at Belmont University saw an opportunity and started Spring Back Recycling with the dual goal of diverting valuable resources from the landfill while providing jobs for previously incarcerated people.\n\n\t \n\n\tSpring Back Recycling, a registered nonprofit, is currently being run by the Belmont Church and students from Belmont's Students in Free Enterprise. You can read more about the group over at the Spring Back Recycling website and NPR, which recently did a story about the operation.\n\n\t \n\n\tHere's a quick video:\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\tAre you on Twitter? Follow me (@sheagunther) there, I give good tweets.\n\n\t \n\n\tAnd if you really like my writing, you can join my Facebook page.","web_category":"lifestyle#recycling","advice_category":"8","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/mattresses-feat.jpg","title":"Spring Back Recycling: Saving mattresses from being thrown away while creating jobs","author":""}
