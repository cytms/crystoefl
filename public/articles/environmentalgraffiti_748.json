It is hard to tell which direction to go in, and in the harsh volcanic landscape, even harder to judge distances. The terrain is tough as hell, undulating underfoot and too hot to proceed in places. Then there is the lava to think about. In a flash, the base of the fresh cone above the lava skylight collapses, giving way to a huge surge of molten rock that rapidly begins flooding the entire area where he and the others are stood.\nAs it happened: The hazardous hornito collapse and lava floodPhoto: \nIt was day three of an expedition to observe Hawaii's ever active volcanic vents. That morning, Tom and the others in the group had established camp, following a stunning hike to fetch water \u2013 water now invaluable for wetting parched throats and splashing over boots half melted by the scalding terrain. Thank heavens for good soles; the footwear will still need fixing, but hopefully that's all. With the encroaching lava, the more pressing challenge is to climb their way out of there \u2013 and fast.\nScenes through the eyes of Dr Tom Pfeiffer: An erupting skylight after sunset Photo: \nThe life of volcanologist sounds either supremely exciting or downright foolish, depending on how far your definition of adventurous extends beyond the latest Wii game. But for those geologists and volcano aficionados whose very blood runs like pyroclastic flows, it has to be the perfect job \u2013 and leading expeditions to many of the planet\u2019s most active volcanoes, like treading a heaven on earth. But isn\u2019t it dangerous?\nLava dance: A 2m-high, pulsating dome fountain of fluid, boiling lava eruptsPhoto: \nUpon hearing the word danger, Tom Pfeiffer is cool; not dismissive, but he thinks the word is overused when people talk about volcanoes. The media especially likes to focus on their destructive power, but that\u2019s not how he sees them. \u201cIt\u2019s the beauty and deep emotions felt in the presence of lava and eruptions,\u201d he tells Environmental Graffiti. Rather than of danger, the guide of over 50 volcano tours across three continents prefers another word: \u201cExcitement.\u201d\nHornito's nest: One of the small, rootless spatter cones erupts, throwing out lavaPhoto: \nA few days earlier, the group had spent two nights close to some lava cones. On the second night, a surge of lava went shooting up into the air. Five smouldering hornitos \u2013 small, rootless lava cones \u2013 suddenly ignited, spitting out fountains of lava 10 metres high. \u201cIt was magical. Lava had accumulated in the pond of lava lying beneath the tall volcanic cones, and suddenly there was this \u2013 while all around stretched a vast lava field, a vast lava landscape.\u201d Magical.\nEyes to the ground: observing an active vent in the center of the craterPhoto: \n\u201cAdventure,\u201d says Tom. \u201cThe people on the exhibition had an extraordinary feeling that day. Of course you need luck. For conditions to be ideal you need extraordinary luck. But then the emotion! It\u2019s less a sense of danger than the excitement of entering the unknown \u2013 the unknown of volcanic activity, of the weather \u2013 and the feeling of being alone with one of nature\u2019s great forces. For while there are thousands of visitors, nobody sees the same things.\u201d\nSafe distance: A spatter cone spits lava inside the gap of Kilauea's active vent Photo: \nAre there risks? \u201cOf course there are risks. It\u2019s risky if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. But if you know what you\u2019re doing it\u2019s as safe as riding a mountain bike.\u201d And it has never been dangerous, except on the one occasion. \u201cI don\u2019t make it dangerous,\u201d explains Tom. \u201cI don\u2019t do it unless I think it\u2019s safe. It can be safe even when we\u2019re up close. Risk is apparent because it\u2019s an alien environment. You\u2019ve got to know how to prevent danger, then you\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\nWhat doesn't kill you: The incoming wave of lava flood once morePhoto: \nSo did he prevent danger in Hawaii when the overflow of lava occurred? \u201cWe were forced to leave our observation positions quickly and retreat to higher ground. When we got to around 30 metres away from the source, we saw that the arriving wave of lava was at least one metre high.\u201d Naturally, it\u2019s all part of the appeal: \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting \u2013 good conditions, good weather, hiking, camping out in the testing volcanic terrain, the risk \u2013 but it\u2019s all worth it for the beauty.\u201d\nRivers of lava: Kilauea's sea entry point, where hot lava rushes into the oceanPhoto: \nIt should be clear by now that feeling and passion are what interest Tom Pfeiffer about volcanoes. It is not even always possible to take photographs, what with technical limitations and not having film handy; yet photos cannot capture what it\u2019s like to be face to face with these stirring ruptures in the earth\u2019s crust. \u201cThe passion comes first. And people might then be inspired to study and explore the world of volcanoes further.\u201d\nLava toes: A pahoehoe lava field class with its smooth, billowy or ropy surfacePhoto: \nIn his time, Tom has spent months on end working as a volunteer at the volcano observatory at Hawaii as well as elsewhere, setting out on many expeditions with friends and colleagues. After studying in Europe, he founded Volcano Discovery, an international team of volcanologists who take tours in places as far flung as Iceland, Indonesia and Alaska. As with any work, it\u2019s not all excitement; there is book keeping and databases \u2013 but they\u2019re another story.\nHot shots: Another sea entry point, and a hornito throwing out spatter (below)Photo: \nWith special thanks to Dr Tom Pfeiffer for agreeing to be interviewed for this article.
