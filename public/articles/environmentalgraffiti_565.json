Some you can try are daylilies, lavender, irises, milkweed, phlox, asters, cosmos, clover, and zinnia. All of these flowers contain nectar. Make sure you plant a variety of these because different species of butterflies are attracted to different flowers. You also need to place out some kind of water or birdbath.
