This flies in the face of previous estimates, which had put the level of shipping emissions as roughly the same as those from aircraft.\nIntertanko suggests that global trade growth in combination with ships delivering freight more quickly, which burns more fuel, are the biggest reasons for the increase.\nShips face few restrictions on the amount of CO2 they emit, and their emissions levels are measured far more rarely than airplanes.  Certain governments, however, are considering instituting methods to reduce ship emissions as they attempt to fight global warming.\nSource: BBC\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"science","title":"Big Steamy Ships Produce Massive Emissions","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/foxy3.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/big-steamy-ships-produce-massive-emissions/340"}
