Stashed with the 185-year-old bubbly\u2014made by Veuve Clicquot, Heidsieck and the defunct house Juglar\u2014were five bottles of a humbler brew with an equally devoted following and a longer history.\nGolden and cloudy, with hints of seawater and a sour odor that expert tasters likened to French cheese, the resurrected ale may be the oldest drinkable beverage of its kind. And if Finnish scientists can crack its original formula, it may also serve as the template for the most faithful beer reproduction in history.\n\u201dWhat we want to do first of all is to analyze the contents of the bottles,\u201d explained Rainer Juslin of the provincial government of Aland, the Finnish-controlled archipelago where the two-mast ship went down while en route to St. Petersburg between 1800 and 1830. \u201cAfter that, we hope to be able to recreate the original recipe so that it can be used to make beer.\u201d\nWorking for Finland\u2019s VTT Technical Research Center, which recently commissioned a study of the beer, researchers have already discovered yeast and bacteria cells in the liquid extracted from the bottles. Still, they have yet to identify the specific type of yeast or to determine whether the microbes survived two centuries in icy waters at depths exceeding 150 feet. They also hope to reveal whether hops were among the brew\u2019s ingredients and to gauge the quality of drinking water used in its preparation.\n\u201cIt is very interesting to find out what kind of yeast was used in beer brewing in the early 1800s, and what the beer\u2019s quality was like,\u201d VTT spokeswoman Annika Wilhelmson said in a statement. \u201cWas it perhaps very strong and bitter? The role of yeast in beer brewing was not yet fully understood in the early 1800s.\u201d\nVTT plans to publish a scientific paper outlining its findings in May 2011 before developing a plan to mass-produce the historic beverage. The wreck\u2019s Champagne, meanwhile, will be sold at an auction and may fetch up to $100,000 per bottle.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Beer from 19th-Century Shipwreck May Be Brewed Again","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/images/topic/content/inline/shipwreck-beer-inline.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/beer-from-19th-century-shipwreck-may-be-brewed-again"}
