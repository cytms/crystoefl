This is a neat adaptation in an environment where food abundance changes dramatically both among seasons and years.\"\nThis behavior had long been suspected by biologists, who frequently found eggshell in fox scat. This behavior is original among carnivores. Some meat-eaters do store food, but only for very short periods of time and very infrequently.  In arctic foxes these stored eggs accounted for anywhere between 28% and 74% of their diet depending on availability of other food.\nEggs are a good food source for storage because of the protective shell and the anti-microbial properties of certain substances within the egg whites.\nFoxes were also observed moving the eggs from one storage place to another fairly frequently. Scientists think that this behavior relates to the way the animals memorize the locations of their stored eggs.\nSource: National Geographic\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Arctic Foxes Are Better Savers Than You","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/cuteyjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/arctic-foxes-are-better-savers-than-you/400"}
