The feeling of freedom, the rush of the wind, the amazing views of the tiny landscapes so far below\u2026 It\u2019s like entering the domain of the birds. Now imagine you had an actual bird as your guide, trained to lead you to the best thermals and to show you the ropes. That\u2019s the basis of parahawking, an extreme sport that was created in the Pokhara area of Nepal by adventurous British bird enthusiast and conservationist Scott Mason.\nPhoto: Scott Mason via Parahawking.com\nThe dark lines of the glider are mirrored in the Egyptian vulture\u2019s wings.\nMason, who also founded the Parahawking Project to raise money \u201cfor vital conservation projects in Nepal,\u201d explains to EG how he first got the idea for parahawking. \u201cI was a falconer/bird trainer first and foremost. I learned to fly simply so I could fly with the black kite chicks that we had rescued in Nepal when I was on my travels. Parahawking was a concept and word that was made up after a few too many beers with my paragliding instructor.\u201d\nMason was certainly in the right place for the activity. \u201cPokhara has all the elements to make a great paragliding site,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has a temperate climate, meaning that it\u2019s flyable for most of the year, [and] beautiful views of the Himalayas, which also provide protection from extreme weather systems. And it also has a steady stream of adventure-seeking tourists, making it great for business. Pokhara is now the busiest tandem site in the world, with around 22 paragliding companies operating.\u201d\nPhoto: Scott Mason via Parahawking.com\nScott Mason, founder of the Parahawking Project, with a tandem paraglider\nIn many ways, parahawking is a lot like paragliding \u2013 with the added bonus of sharing the experience with one of Nepal\u2019s magnificent avian species. Participants take tandem paragliding flights with a member of the parahawking team, accompanied by a trained bird of prey.\nParagliders use thermals, bursts of warm air rising from the ground in currents, to soar effortlessly through the skies. Raptors do the same thing, and so they\u2019re adept at finding these currents. Trained raptors make wonderful companions for paragliders, leading them to the best thermals in return for tasty bits of meat.\nPhoto: Scott Mason via Parahawking.com\nAn Egyptian vulture swoops near a gloved hand, high above the land.\nNepal is home to more than 80 different species of birds of prey. Sadly, some of these species are under threat \u2013 including the Egyptian vulture, two specimens of which were rescued and are now used by the parahawking team. Fortunately, Mason soon realized that parahawking could be used for conservation purposes as well as sport.\n\u201cThe whole idea of parahawking was simply to train our own birds to fly with us and to guide us to the best thermals,\u201d recalls Mason. \u201cIt soon became more about enriching the lives of rescue birds that could not be released back into the wild and also to promote vital conservation issues surrounding birds of prey.\u201d\nPhoto: Scott Mason via Parahawking.com\nA paragliding parachute and an Egyptian vulture, as seen from below\n\u201cAll vultures in Nepal are on the decline, even Egyptian vultures.\u201d Mason tells us. \u201cThey are persecuted, poisoned, electrocuted and are also dying due to the effects of Diclofenac, the drug that\u2019s responsible for decimating the rest of Asia\u2019s vulture population. However, there is a massive conservation effort to prevent the extinction of all vultures, in which we believe we play an important part.\u201d\nPhoto: Bettina Boemans via Parahawking.com\nThe glorious and threatened Egyptian vulture up close\nOne of the conservation efforts made by Mason\u2019s Parahawking Project is to raise important funds for the Himalayan Raptor Rescue center. Mason also says that \u201cthe project was made a patron of the Ghachowk Vulture Restaurant last year. This is an important safe feeding area where eight species of Nepal\u2019s endangered vultures can be seen feeding at close quarters from Diclofenac-free food.\u201d\n\u201cFunds from parahawking helped to build the [restaurant] site and to promote it as a tourist attraction. I believe in time the vulture numbers will begin to climb again, but they may never reach the numbers that they were [at] 15 years ago,\u201d adds Mason.\nPhoto: Jessica Love via Parahawking.com\nA snow-capped mountain is just visible in the bottom right-hand corner.\nThe birds used by the parahawking team have all been saved from bad situations. For example, Brad the black kite was living in a small wire cage, gaunt and suffering from feather damage, when he was found. Bob and Kevin, the Egyptian vultures, were discovered in the same area during monsoons \u2013 although at different times \u2013 and could possibly be siblings.\n\u201cAll of the birds that are trained for parahawking are rescue birds \u2013 we don\u2019t take birds from the wild or breed birds in captivity, although captive breeding is something we would like to do in the future,\u201d says Mason. \u201cWe have rescued over 70 birds in the last 12 years. Most of the birds are successfully rehabilitated and returned to the wild.\u201d\nPhoto: Scott Mason via Parahawking.com\nRegular paragliders can be seen in the background enjoying the stunning scenery.\nUnfortunately, not all the birds can be taken back to their natural habitats. \u201cBirds that are brought in as young chicks have to be hand-reared, which in some cases makes it impossible for that bird to be successfully released into the wild,\u201d Mason tells us. \u201cIt is those birds that tend to stay with us so, [and] as part of an enrichment program, [they] are trained for parahawking.\u201d\nThere has been some criticism of parahawking, mainly centered on the keeping of endangered animals. However, the project has won acclaim from some quarters, as in 2010 it was given the International Association for Avian Trainers and Educators Enrichment Behaviour Award.\nVideo: Scott Mason via YouTube\nParahawking may even hold an appeal for those not normally into adventure sports. \u201cOur passengers are pretty much all not pilots, just tourists that want to experience something a little different to normal paragliding. In actual fact, our passengers tend to be people with an interest in birds,\u201d says Mason.\n\u201cOur research has shown that over 85 percent of them would not have taken a paragliding flight if it wasn\u2019t for the birds. We love our passengers, they are passionate and positive about giving something back to the environment \u2013 many of them book over a year in advance and will plan their entire trip around their parahawking experience.\u201d\nFor more information, visit the parahawking Facebook page.\nSources: 1, 2, 3","author":"Yohani Kamarudin","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Parahawking: Taking to the Skies With Birds of Prey As Guides","picture_url":"http://static.techgraffiti.com/2013/05/Pilot-and-tandem-passenger-parahawking.jpg","url":"http://www.techgraffiti.com/parahawking-taking-to-the-skies-with-birds-of-prey-to-guide-you"}
