Known for its grand temples and lush, picturesque setting overlooking the Mediterranean on the southwest coast of Sicily, the city was leveled during a brutal siege by the Carthaginians in 409 B.C. At its height in the sixth century B.C., colonial officials coped with a major population boom by developing a new urban model based on a street grid, a circuit of walls and zones earmarked for specific activities, ancient sources recount.\nRecent excavations at Selinus, as the Greeks called it, uncovered one of these planned neighborhoods, Zuchtriegel and his team have revealed. Stretching for more than a quarter mile along the city\u2019s outer walls, a pottery district once housed living quarters and studios for local artisans. This peripheral location allowed them to practice their craft without drawing the ire of touchy neighbors, Zuchtriegel said. \u201cTheir smoke, stench and noise did not inconvenience the other inhabitants as much,\u201d he explained.\nAlong with workshop remnants and pottery fragments, the Bonn archaeologists\u2014many of them students\u2014unearthed giant 7,000-year-old kilns up to 23 feet in diameter. This suggests that Selinunte\u2019s craftsmen shared equipment and facilities, perhaps as members of artists\u2019 cooperatives, Zuchtriegel said.\nSo did ancient Greek cities feature arty, off-the-beaten-path enclaves reminiscent of Manhattan\u2019s SoHo or Paris\u2019 Left Bank? The latest discovery and ongoing excavations at Selinunte might bring experts closer to answering that question\u2014and to painting a clearer picture of urban life in antiquity.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"An Ancient Greek SoHo?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/selinunte-wide.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/an-ancient-greek-soho"}
