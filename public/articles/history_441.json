As a result, the satellite images showed both known archaeological sites that have been studied and excavated for decades and other ancient treasures ostensibly buried deep beneath the sand. When Parcak and her colleagues pinpointed famous pyramids captured by the cameras, for instance, they also spotted similar-looking structures nearby, an indication that our inventory of ancient Egypt\u2019s most iconic architectural marvels is incomplete. \u201cFor me, the exciting part is the possibility,\u201d Parcak said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what these things might be, but we know there\u2019s something there.\u201d\nAmong other significant locations, Parcak and her colleagues used the technology to create an infrared map of Tanis, an ancient Egyptian capital located near modern-day San El-Hagar that was famously portrayed in the Indiana Jones movie \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark.\u201d The city provided the most compelling evidence yet for the technique\u2019s accuracy when researchers attempted to unearth sites that cropped up in the satellite pictures. \u201cThe most important thing is to test it on the ground,\u201d Parcak said, \u201cso we partnered with a French archaeology team and they excavated a house or medium-sized structure that appeared on the satellite imagery.\u201d\nSure enough, the results of the dig lined up with the satellite plan of Tanis. \u201cWhen I saw what they excavated, that was an incredible validation,\u201d Parcak recalled. \u201cIt really is like the blueprint of a city,\u201d she added. \u201cTo get a map like that with excavation would take so long, and we got it not quite instantly but pretty quickly.\u201d\nEgyptian authorities have also hailed the technology as a major breakthrough and conducted a trial excavation at the ancient site of Saqqara. Using satellite imagery of the area as a guide, they uncovered two pyramids that had been hidden from view for centuries. Recently, Parcak met with Egypt\u2019s antiquities minister, Zahi Hawass, and other members of the Egyptian government to discuss how these methods can be used to protect and preserve archaeological sites. She also hopes to partner with Hawass and others to develop a program that trains young Egyptians to harness the power of satellite imaging for conservation work.\nOther archaeologists are already employing the new technique, including at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. There, researchers used it to determine that one well-known site is three to four times larger than previously thought, Parcak said.\nFor Parcak, the precise mapping afforded by the technology has the potential to shed light on the daily lives of ancient Egyptians and the relationship they had with their natural environment. For instance, there is evidence that Egyptians moved their settlements based on the shifting of the Nile\u2019s banks. \u201cUltimately, what it shows is that we need to be asking different questions about ancient Egyptian society,\u201d she said.\nParcak expects that the technology will continue to advance, eventually becoming capable of distinguishing sites that the Nile River has covered in deep silt and rendered invisible even from space. But no matter what, she cautioned, excavation is the key to corroborating satellite imagery with 100-percent certainty. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cThe important thing is to get the data out there and validate it.\u201d\nFind out more about the ongoing work of Parcak and her team?here.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Satellite Images Provide Blueprint for Ancient Egypt","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dr-parcak.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/satellite-images-provide-blueprint-for-ancient-egypt"}
