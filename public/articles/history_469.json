Their findings, published this week in the journal Science, challenge the prevailing assumption that dinosaurs dominated the daylight hours, leaving early mammals no choice but to venture out at night.\n\u201cWe can now clearly demonstrate that dinosaurs were not strictly day-active,\u201d explained Lars Schmitz, a postdoctoral researcher and co-author of the paper. \u201cWe can solidly end the view that all dinosaurs were diurnal whereas mammals were nocturnal. If mammals truly\u2013which still needs to be shown\u2013were hiding from the dinosaurs in the dark, the dinosaurs were certainly capable of following them.\u201d\nSchmitz and his colleague, Ryosuke Motani, a professor of geology and co-author of the paper, reached these groundbreaking conclusions about dinosaurs\u2019 daily schedules after verifying that eye size and dimensions can accurately predict whether animals are active by day, by night or at all hours. Diurnal (day-active) animals feature a small opening in the middle of their scleral ring, the bony ocular structure found in dinosaurs, lizards and birds but not in humans and other mammals. Nocturnal animals have a much larger opening, while cathemeral creatures\u2014which roam about regardless of the time\u2014fall somewhere in between.\nThe researchers compared the scleral rings and eye sockets of dinosaurs and other ancient beasts to those of 164 living species with known habits. They discovered that plant-eating dinosaurs probably grazed by night and day, much like modern herbivores such as elephants. Small carnivorous dinosaurs like the spry velociraptors of \u201cJurassic Park\u201d fame, meanwhile, prowled for prey by the light of the moon. (Large carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus rex were excluded from the study because no fossils with sufficiently preserved scleral rings were available.)\n\u201cIt was a surprise, but it makes sense,\u201d Motani said of the study\u2019s results. For example, large herbivores probably needed to snack around the clock because of their massive metabolisms. As for predators like velociraptors, it has already been established that they benefit from the cover of darkness while stalking their victims.\nPerhaps most of all, the study raises major questions about the behavior patterns of early mammals, which were previously thought to have a monopoly on nocturnality, said H. Richard Lane, program director in the National Science Foundation\u2019s Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research along with the German government. Modern mammals can be diurnal, nocturnal or cathemeral, with human beings falling into the first category.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Jurassic Dark: Study Suggests Dinosaurs Hunted at Night","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dinosaur-hunting-thumb.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/jurassic-dark-study-suggests-dinosaurs-hunted-at-night"}
