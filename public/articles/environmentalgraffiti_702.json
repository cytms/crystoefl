Buildings, fences, houses of worship \u2013 nothing is sacred when it comes to the power of sand; sweeping across landscapes, slowly devouring everything in its path. Let us ponder what once was, and discover astonishing and surprising treasures. Shipwrecks and fishing boats seem obvious, but planes, trains and automobiles? Or a whole village? See for yourself all that has been unearthed.   \nAs the following images will show, shifting sand dunes, the advancing desert and erosion are problems that make people abandon not only their cars but also fighter jets, buildings, railroad tracks and villages. The remains of these buried treasures are reminders of what once was \u2013 the glorious days of steamships, for example \u2013 that still attract throngs of people once uncovered.  \n\nBelow is the former home of an all-African American life saving station, located between Nag's Head and Cape Hatteras, on Pea Island, NC. Now owned by the National Wildlife Refuge, it seems deserted, literally.  \n1. A house swallowed by sand dunes on Pea Island, NC:Photo: \nImage: Badger 23\n2.

A snack stall? Bathrooms? Changing cabins?\n3. A building taken over by the sand on Bali, Indonesia:Photo: \nImage: Michael Cannon\n4.

Located at strategic points like road junctions, canals and the sea shore, of the 24,000 pillboxes constructed, today only about 6,000 have survived.  \n5.

Since then, new buildings have come up but the original ones wait to be fully devoured by sand. The railway line that connected Dhanushkodi to the outside world was hit particularly hard: six attempts were made to resurrect it but it was covered by sand dunes in no time so that the tracks as well as the idea of a connection were finally abandoned. Visitors today have to come to the town on foot along the shore or in jeeps over sand dunes.   \n7. Church ruins in Dhanushkodi, India:Photo: \nImage: Prashanth K. S. \n8.

They have to be excavated every 12 years or else would just disappear from view.\n9. Devoured by sand dunes \u2013 the Thalakkad temples in Kerala: Photo: \nImage: Mahendra M.\n10.

Olson, launched in 1917, collided with another ship and was thrown off course and onto the rocks in 1944. Nobody was injured and the vessel later pulled into the harbour to salvage whatever possible. Some of the ship\u2019s load \u2013 lumber \u2013 built the Baptist Church in Charleston. Though grounded in late 1944, the George L. Olson had a tendency to pop up over the decades. Storms moved sand off it and uncovered the ship in the \u201860s but once covered again, it was quickly forgotten. When it surfaced again in February 2008, though, it attracted quite a bit of attention.     \n11. Shipwreck of the George L. Olson in Coos Bay, OR:Photo: \nImage: Misserion\nThe Eduard Bohlen is ship that ran aground on Namibia's aptly named Skeleton Coast in 1909 in a thick fog. It now lies in the sand quite a bit off the shoreline, some say with the passenger and crew bones still buried in the sand... \n12.

Maheno was beached on Fraser Island in Queensland, Australia, after it got caught in a cyclone in 1935. The wreck served as target bombing practice for the RAAF during World War II and is today one of Fraser Island\u2019s main landmarks, even though more than three storys are buried under the sand. Originally built as a luxury liner in Scotland in 1905, it served as a hospital ship during World War I before turning into a luxury liner once again. Considered outdated, the ship left for its last voyage from Melbourne to Japan to be turned into scrap metal when it was caught in the cyclone and never left Australia after all.     \n13.

Some of them have been dug out and restored by the U.S. Air Force. The MiG-25 Foxbat fighter can now be seen at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, OH.   \n15.

The chain link fence and the sign that must have once been as tall as a person are now almost completely buried by sand. Notice the sign warning people not to swim \u2013 in the sand maybe?\n21.

Here's the first and last stanza of Hans Magnus Enzensberger's poem \"The Vanished\":\nIt wasn't the earth that swallowed them. Was it the air?\nNumerous as the sand, they did not become\nsand, but came to naught instead. They've been forgotten\nin droves. \nThe vanished are just.\nThat's how we'll fade, too. \n\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
