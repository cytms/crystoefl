In the past, experts relied on two different techniques for estimating the erstwhile body mass of fossilized creatures, said University of Manchester researcher Bill Sellers, lead author of a new paper on dinosaur weight published in Biology Letters. \u201cOne very common method is to take an artist\u2019s reconstruction sculpture of the animal and measure its volume by dipping it in water just like Archimedes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem with this is the artist\u2019s reconstruction. These are both very time-consuming to do and probably rather inaccurate.\u201d\nThe other approach involves using living animals to calculate the relationship between a specific body part, such as a leg bone, and total weight. Measurements from a specimen are then fed into the resulting equation. \u201cThe problem with this is that it doesn\u2019t use very much of the available information and leads to very large uncertainty in body mass,\u201d Sellers said.\nHoping to pioneer a better system, Sellers and his colleagues used laser imaging to scan the skeletons of 14 large mammals, including a bison, a camel, an elephant and a polar bear. They divided each scan into parts and mathematically \u201cwrapped\u201d the components to establish a minimum weight. Next, they compared this figure to real body mass information available in scientific literature. \u201cWe found for the living animals that this absolutely minimum weight was reliably 20 percent lower than the actual body weights of the animal, so by adding the missing 20 percent we could calculate the actual weight,\u201d Sellers said.\nThe team then applied the same logic to a relatively complete skeletal specimen of Brachiosaurus, or Giraffatitan brancai, one of the largest sauropod dinosaurs. After scanning and mathematically wrapping a mounted skeleton from the Museum f?r Naturkunde in Berlin, they added 20 percent to the calculated minimum weight. \u201cIt turns out from this that the mass of the Berlin Brachiosaurus was 23 tons, which is very much at the low end of the previous ranges of predicted body weights\u2014which go up to almost 80 tons at the highest end,\u201d Sellers explained.\nSellers said he believes his team\u2019s new method is more reliable than older approaches. \u201cFirstly, we include all the information from the complete skeleton rather than choosing just one aspect,\u201d he noted. \u201cSecondly, the method is completely objective. At no point is any subjective judgment required to estimate the amount of soft tissue on the animal. That also means that it is completely repeatable. If two people repeat the process with the same skeleton they will get the same answer.\u201d\nIf the process were applied to other dinosaurs, it would reveal that the giant beasts were not as big as previously thought, Sellers said. And the new mass estimates could have significant implications for scientists\u2019 understanding of how dinosaurs lived. \u201cBody mass is the single most important biological parameter for any animal,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt affects physiology, anatomy, behavior and ecology.\u201d\nThis unexpected weight loss doesn\u2019t mean dinosaurs were any less monstrous or terrifying\u2014but they might have been slightly more graceful, according to Sellers. \u201cTwenty tons is still a very large animal indeed, and it is still over 25 meters long, so these are still fearsome creatures,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I think it shows is that they are perhaps not as ponderous as the higher weight estimates might lead you to think. Over the last 40 years research has shown that dinosaurs are not slow-moving, cold-blooded giant lizards but they are much more active and dynamic. I think a gradual reduction in predicted body mass goes hand in hand with this interpretation.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"The Biggest Losers: Dinosaurs Slim Down With Lasers","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/berlin-brachiosaurus.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/the-biggest-losers-dinosaurs-slim-down-with-lasers"}
