In addition to its large avian population, it is called home by river otters, moose, gray wolves, beavers and black bears.\n?\nThe abundance of diverse wildlife isn't the refuge's only claim to fame. Within the park is the Strangmoor Bog, a National Natural Landmark considered to be the best surviving example of a subarctic patterned bog ecosystem within the contiguous U.S.\n?\n\n* * *?\n?\nCatie Leary is a photo editor at Mother Nature Network.
