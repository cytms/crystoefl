Hidden off the beaten track within Parque Nacional de Do?ana (Do?ana National Park), Andaluc?a is something that bears a remarkable resemblance to the human brain.\nDiscovered by photographer Hector Garrido during an investigation of the National Park on behalf of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient?ficas (Scientific Investigation Council), this awesome image shows natural fractals from vegetation at the end of a small river delta. It looks as if the clearing was once a small lake within the marshland but has since dried up considerably, leaving a brain-like appearance to the landscape.\nAlthough not an exact fractal by definition \u2013 the shapes aren\u2019t identically replicated throughout the pattern \u2013 the clearing does have self-repeating quality of a fractal, as does the brain. These other images by the same photographer in various other parks in the south of Spain demonstrates just how often the fractal pattern is seen throughout nature, something we wouldn\u2019t be able to spot within the help of these great images.\nLocated within the provinces of Huelva, Sevilla and C?diz, Parque Nacional de Do?ana has grown around the delta of the Guadalquivir River and is one of Europe's most prominent wetland reserves and conservation centers. It covers an immense 1,300 sq km area and is popular with a huge variety of migrating birds, including five threatened bird species and the critically endangered Iberian Lynx.\nSource 1, 2, 3","author":"Linda","web_category":"nature","title":"Earth's Fractal Brain From Above [PICS]","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb32.webshots.com-44383-2956446000104178106S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/earths-fractal-brain-above/6004"}
