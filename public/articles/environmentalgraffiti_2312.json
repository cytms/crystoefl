From preliminary preparations (pumpkin selection and disposal) to the main event (a sustainable Halloween house party), we\u2019ve got you covered with five ghoulishly easy tips to lighten your eco-impact this Halloween. So do yourself a favor and have an environmentally friendly fear-fest, or else \u2026 you wouldn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry!\n1. Picking the Perfect PumpkinPhoto: jr conlin\nIt\u2019s important to remember that with every small decision you make, you can turn your normal \u201cwhatever-is-easiest\u201d routine into a new \u201cwhat-is-most-responsible\u201d method of thinking. For instance, instead of grabbing a pumpkin out of the bin at your nearest mega-mart, cut it from the vine yourself at a local pumpkin patch. Then, once the ghouls and goblins have receded, complete the cycle and compost your pumpkin and its slowly melting jack-o-lantern smile.\n2. Customize Your CostumesPhoto: L. Marie\nThat incredible $50 costume might be right up your alley, but consider either making one with creativity and offhand objects or repurposing or borrowing an old one. Also avoid makeup that may have been tested on animals. You\u2019ll likely have more fun without worrying how much you paid and feel more satisfied knowing your costume came at zero additional cost to the environment.\n3. Get Creative with CandyPhoto: spablab\nTooth-killing treats are very scary indeed. Green your candy options with organic goodies and treats or tiny treasures such as bubble kits and other cheap, eco-friendly toys. You won\u2019t have to feel guilty about all those candy wrappers and your kids and trick-or-treaters will have a mouthful of smiles instead of cavities.\n4. Party SmarterPhoto: MickeyJMoran\nDecorations, plastic cups, paper plates \u2014 before you know it, you could have a landfill rising from your kitchen trashcan during your annual Halloween party. Try to avoid this terrifying trouble by using your dishes and glasses (that is what they\u2019re for, by the way) and borrowing or reusing Halloween decorum. So you might have to wash a few dishes or store a few streamers: just remember, what\u2019s easiest isn\u2019t always what\u2019s best.\n5.
