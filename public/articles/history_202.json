Inside was America\u2019s most infamous duo\u2014Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. For nearly two years, the outlaws\u2014and lovers\u2014had captured headlines as they eluded authorities on one of the most notorious crime sprees in history. Along with the \u201cBarrow Gang,\u201d Bonnie and Clyde had gone on a binge of kidnappings, murders and robberies, knocking off banks, country stores and gas stations throughout the South and Midwest. While there are conflicting accounts as to whether Bonnie ever fired a shot, according to the FBI the couple is believed to have committed 13 murders\nThe 1934 Ford driven by Clyde through the Louisiana pines that morning was a veritable arsenal on wheels. Inside were three Browning Automatic Rifles, two sawed-off shotguns, almost a dozen handguns and thousands of rounds of ammunition. In case that wasn\u2019t enough, tucked inside Clyde\u2019s waistband was a Colt .45 Army pistol, believed to have been stolen from the federal arsenal in Beaumont, Texas. Concealed beneath Bonnie\u2019s red dress was a Colt .38 revolver taped to her inner thigh with white medical adhesive tape.\n\u201cSeldom did anyone ever live when Clyde got the first shot,\u201d warned a newsreel of the day. On this day, however, Clyde never even had a chance to grab for his Colt. A six-man posse led by retired Texas Ranger captain Frank Hamer, hiding in the bushes on the side of the dirt byway, unleashed a fatal blizzard of gunshots into the vehicle carrying Bonnie and Clyde. The lawmen emptied their automatic rifles, then their shotguns and then their pistols. They pumped more than 130 rounds of steel-jacketed bullets into the car. The duo was killed nearly instantly. When the authorities opened the doors of the automobile after the ambush, they found Bonnie\u2019s body leaning on Clyde\u2019s.\nAs part of his bounty, Hamer was given the Colt Model 1911 U.S. Army pistol recovered from Clyde\u2019s waistband and the snub-nose detective special revolver found on Bonnie\u2019s leg. The guns were passed down to Hamer\u2019s son and then sold to a private collector. Last week, New Hampshire-based RR Auction announced that the guns, along with other personal effects recovered from Bonnie and Clyde\u2019s perforated car, will be sold to the highest bidder during a live auction on September 30.\nBobby Livingston of RR Auction said he expects each gun to go for at least $100,000. \u201cAs far as handguns connected to Bonnie and Clyde, these are the finest you can have as a collector,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were on the market last in 1986, so we are obviously getting intense interest. These items are as close to Bonnie and Clyde as you can get.\u201d\nOther items up for sale include Bonnie\u2019s light brown leatherette cosmetic case\u2014minus the lipstick, box of face powder and powder puff that were found inside after the ambush. Another item up for bid is Clyde\u2019s Elgin pocket watch, which has a 10-karat gold-filled screw-back case. The watch was among the personal effects returned to Clyde\u2019s father, along with his body. Clyde\u2019s father wore the watch in memory of his son for more than 20 years until his death.\nMore than 100 other lots that are part of RR Auction\u2019s \u201cGangsters, Outlaws and Lawmen\u201d collection will be up for bid on September 30, including a letter written by John Dillinger from prison and a handwritten score of \u201cMadonna Mia,\u201d a song composed by Al Capone while he was incarcerated at Alcatraz.","author":"Christopher  Klein","web_category":"news","title":"Guns Found on Outlaws Bonnie and Clyde for Sale","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bonnie-gun.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/guns-found-on-outlaws-bonnie-and-clyde-for-sale"}
