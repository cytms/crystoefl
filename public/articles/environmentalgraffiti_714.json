Its strange looks can probably be attributed to the fact that it is a living fossil \u2013 yes, the aardvark\u2019s chromosomes reflect much of life before modern taxonomy. Let\u2019s see how life begins for little aardvarks because guess what, as placentals, they are more closely related to us humans than marsupials. Ready for pics that\u2019ll make you go cuuuuuute?\nA six-week-old aardvark baby:Photo: \nImage: vinniecfp\nAfter a pregnancy of six months, aardvark mothers give birth to a single baby, rarely two. The cubs weigh between 1 and 2 kg at birth and gain weight rapidly, often ten times their birth weight in two months. They feed exclusively from the mother until they are 14 weeks old and then start their staple diet of termites and ants. \n Pst, mama, lend me your ear. Where is it?Photo: \nImage via afrika meine tierklinik \nAt six months of age, aardvarks are able to dig their own burrows and start living separately but will often stay close to the mother until her next mating season. \nAmani, one of two aardvark babies at Detroit Zoo, at the age of six months:Photo: \nImage: Patti Panda\nAnd Erdferkel (German for aardvark), the second baby at the zoo, born 23rd May:Photo: \nImage via zandavisitor\nAt two years of age, aardvarks will start mating. They pair only in breeding season and though some animals may have their burrows close together, most aardvarks are loners. At 1,65 m long (5 to 6 ft), 60 cm tall and weighing 50 to 70 kg (90 to 145 lb), grown aardvarks can compete with humans in size. \nRelated? Not really:Photo: \nImage via hip2b2\nIf the aardvark looks in parts like a pig, anteater or even kangaroo, then it has to do with the convergent evolution of these mammals rather than an actual relationship. Sometimes you see pictures of furry aardvarks \u2013 except those are not aardvarks but anteaters that have been attributed wrongly. Aardvarks have only coarse, patchy hairs. \nSpot the aardvark? No, it's an anteater! Here at National Zoo in Washington, DC:Photo: \nImage: PauerKorde\nFor the last time, I\u2019m a joey, not an aardvark!Photo: \nImage via baby animal photos\nIn case you were wondering \u2013  the aardvark\u2019s name is not a sloppy way of pronouncing awkward but Afrikaans/Dutch for \u201cearth pig\u201d because that\u2019s what the animal reminded early European settlers in Africa of. \nThe most striking of the aardvark\u2019s strange features is its long snout with a short and tubular mouth, typical for ant- or termite-eating species. The aardvark\u2019s sense of smell is extraordinary and it can be found wherever there are termites. In fact, if food is rare, the aardvark can travel distances of up to 30 km in one night to find the nearest ant hill. It is also an exceptionally fast digger whose strong front paws can crack even the sturdiest termite mound. \nMama, it\u2019s my turn now!Photo: \nImage: Scotto Bear\nWith its long, sticky tongue, an aardvark can pick up an astonishing number of termites, up to 50,000 in one night! That\u2019s quite an appetite and a lot of protein.\nSpeaking of which, the aardvark is the only living representative of the Tubulidentata species, meaning tube teeth: Instead of enamel-covered teeth with a pulp coating, aardvarks have thin, parallel tubes with pulp canals that wear away and regrow continuously. \nSo small now but already a voracious eater:Photo: \nImage via blufftontoday\nAs nocturnal, solitary and shy creatures, it is not surprising that most images of aardvarks are taken in zoos. In the wild, they disappear back into their burrows at the slightest indication of a disturbance. Their natural predators are lions, leopards, hyenas and pythons but, though admired in African folklore, they are also sought after by some tribes for their heart, skin, forehead and nails, used for charm making. Farmers are not too happy when they sight an aardvark on their property because as strong diggers, they can really create havoc in a freshly sown field.       \nLast but not least here\u2019s quite a funny video of two Orycteropus afers at the Philadelphia Zoo. One is going wild with a plastic bucket and the other is jumping on the, er, opportunity to show what other uses that long aardvark snout can be put to.  \nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
