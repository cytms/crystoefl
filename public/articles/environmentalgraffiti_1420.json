The spines of the sea urchin serve as an explicit warning against contact. The alluring texture of the spines draws the touch in spite of the possible consequences.\u201d \nThese pieces of art work may seem like something produced by Mother Nature or grown on a hostile planet, but they actually have quite a lot more in common with an object much closer to home. Each of these sculptures is the product of a beading technique which could equally produce a necklace or bracelet.\nTo create each piece of work, Jennifer cuts pencils into one-inch sections and drills holes into them to turn them into beads. She then sharpens the tip of each pencil section and stitches them together to form the larger structure of the sculpture. \nPhoto: Jennifer Maestre \nJennifer, who exhibits her sculptures across the USA, adds: \u201cUsing this combination of technique and materials allows me to retain all the qualities that I want in my work, with the potential for more variety of form.\u201d\nThis is certainly true judging by the array of creatures produced in Jennifer\u2019s work, which fit perfectly with her aim of mixing \u201caspects of sharp and smooth for two very different textural and aesthetic experiences.\u201d\nPhoto: Jennifer Maestre \nUsing a pencil to form surging, swelling lines has been at the heart of the art world since man began to draw, but Jennifer Maestre has taken that use of form to a completely new level by creating art with the pencil itself.\nWith special thanks to Jennifer Maestre (www.jennifermaestre.com) for taking time out of her busy schedule and allowing Environmental Graffiti access to her artwork.","author":"JaneK","web_category":"art+and+design","title":"Amazing Sculptures Made from Hundreds of Pencil Points","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/incredible-pencil-art.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-alien-dimension-pencil-art"}
