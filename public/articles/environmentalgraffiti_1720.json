A newspaper tries to cling on \u2013 but misses! \u2013  brushed off like a wet blanket. A tray becomes a life raft, a cup with a straw a submarine. Hey, there\u2019s Ronald McDonald, home video hero. He\u2019s floating by, limply, resigned. This is not a scene from a fast-food apocalypse but \"Flooded McDonald\u2019s\", the latest installation from Danish art collective Superflex. Find out how they managed to trade finger pointing for humour.\nEverday objects take on a life of their own in \"Flooded McDonald's\":Photo: \nFirst of all, let\u2019s get the technicalities out of the way: no persons, animals or McDonald\u2019s branches got harmed and all the water used was first collected and then recycled. Superflex, together with a Vietnamese film crew, reconstructed a life-size McDonald\u2019s outlet in Bangkok in painstaking detail, just to submerge it completely. \nEverything was built from scratch: the venue, the tables and chairs, the signs:Photo: \nSays Bj?rnstjerne Christiansen, one of the three Superflex members, in an interview with Don\u2019t Panic magazine about the idea behind \"Flooded McDonald\u2019s\":\n\nThe installation took only four months from conception to first public screening and was shot in one take. Rather than pointing fingers at anyone in particular \u2013 not the fast-food chains, not the customers who frequent them \u2013 it invites viewers to come up with their own explanations. How does what we have viewed fit in with our own lives? Could it happen, and which part would each of us play? Says Christiansen:\nThe making of \"Flooded McDonald's\":Photo: \nSuperflex is a three-member art collective made up of Rasmus Nielsen, Jakob Fenger and Bj?rnstjerne Christiansen. The three friends met at art school in Copenhagen and have been working together since 1993. Well-known installations are the artists\u2019 first film \u201cBurning Car\u201d (2008) and the Free Beer project (2005). The former is a 10-minute film that questions the media\u2019s sensationalism, symbolised by a burning car that seems to be present whenever a story is about to unfold. The Free Beer project applies open source methods to a real-world product: beer. Though no free beer is given out, everyone is invited to use the free recipe provided to make their own. And it\u2019s been improved: Free Beer version 3.0 is out.    \n\"Flooded McDonald\u2019s\" will be screened at South London Gallery until 1st March and can be previewed at Vimeo. Though the general public has been swept away so far, comments from fast-food chains, especially on disaster management, have yet to come. \nSource: 1, 2, 3, 4\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
