Beginning in the 15th century and perhaps earlier, Christian revelers in certain parts of England celebrated May Day with plays and games involving a Robin Hood figure with near-religious significance. In the 19th century, writer-illustrators like Howard Pyle adapted the traditional tales for children. More recently, bringing Robin to the silver screen has become a rite of passage for directors ranging from Michael Curtiz and Ridley Scott to Terry Gilliam and Mel Brooks.\nAcademics, meanwhile, have combed the historical record for evidence of a real Robin Hood\u2014or, at the very least, a real-life figure who inspired his legend. Recently, the bestselling novelist Jack Whyte nominated a candidate with enough pop-culture resonance to rival Robin himself: William Wallace, the Scottish knight who fought against English oppression until his brutal execution in 1305. Nearly seven centuries after his death, he was famously portrayed by Mel Gibson in the blockbuster movie \u201cBraveheart.\u201d\nWallace, a powerful symbol of Scottish nationalism, might seem like an unlikely model for one of England\u2019s archetypal heroes. But Whyte, who moved from Scotland to British Columbia more than 50 years ago, said he stumbled across striking similarities between the two men while writing his latest book, \u201cThe Forest Laird,\u201d which is based on Wallace\u2019s life. (The novel itself does not draw any explicit connections between its subject and Robin Hood.)\nAs part of his research, Whyte examined Wallace\u2019s seal, of which the only surviving example appears on letters penned by the Scottish freedom fighter in 1297. It features a long bow, a possible indication that Wallace, like the mythic bandit from Nottinghamshire, was a skilled archer. Further investigation revealed that, like Robin Hood\u2019s merry men, the young Wallace hid out in Scotland\u2019s Selkirk forest after being accused of poaching and outlawed. And according to legend, his wife, Mirren (Scots for Marian, a name shared by Robin\u2019s love interest), was kidnapped and murdered by William Heselrig, the English sheriff of Lanark, who Wallace later killed.\nWhyte first outlined the parallels he has detected between William Wallace and Robin Hood in a November 2010 interview with Postmedia News. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a genius to add up two and two and get Robin Hood,\u201d he said. \u201cI firmly believe that this man, as a young man, was the archetype from which the legend of Robin Hood grew.\u201d\nTo Thomas Hahn, a Robin Hood scholar and professor of English at the University of Rochester, Whyte\u2019s theory appears implausible on the basis of chronology alone. \u201cThe earliest mention of the outlaw hero\u2013in the poem \u2018Piers Plowman,\u2019 from the 1370s\u2013 implies that by that moment Robin Hood was already an indispensable item in the cultural baggage carried around by every speaker of English,\u201d he said. \u201cLess than a century seems far too little time for a Scots hero, an avowed enemy to England, to morph into the best known and best loved of English action heroes.\u201d\nHahn also pointed out that the Robin Hood of legend and the historical figure of William Wallace embrace starkly different approaches to and justifications for their rebellious acts. \u201cWallace was a political hero, whose violence was motivated by an abstract ideal,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe hallmark of Robin Hood stories is not organized but disorganized crime:?violence is not instrumental, intended to achieve some cause, but spontaneous, spectacular and self-contained.\u201d\nRight or wrong, Whyte\u2019s hypothesis is part of a long tradition, according to Hahn. \u201cThe desire to ground the exploits of Robin Hood in a real time and a real place\u2013to \u2018locate\u2019 him in the recoverable life of a person who lived and died\u2013seems to go back to the 16th century at least,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one individual, however, could have done enough in the span of a lifetime to justify the legends that surround Robin.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"William Wallace: The Real Robin Hood?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/images/topic/content/inline/william-wallace.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/william-wallace-the-real-robin-hood"}
