The dog's owner, who was understandably shocked, discovered that the 4-month old joey, now sporting the unique moniker Rex Junior, had been handled so gently as to not have any marks or be in any sort of distress.\nObviously incapable of caring for the litte darling, Rex's proud owner, Leonie Allan, has decided to turn Junior over to a wildlife sanctuary-- this one--where he'll stay until he's 18 months old and be re-released.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
