Most inhabitants speak the island\u2019s four official languages fluently - Papiamento, English, Spanish and Dutch. As far as religion goes, Christians, Moslems, Hindus, Jews and Africans all practice their faith side by side.  \nFor centuries, people have come from all over the world to this tiny speck in the South Caribbean Sea to try their fortune. Amerindians, Caiquetios, Spanish, Dutch, African slaves, traders from all over the world \u2013 all left their ethnic footprint on the island that is today a well-connected microcosm of the world. Cultural harmony didn\u2019t happen overnight though and Cura?ao\u2019s history is one full of murder, betrayal and exploitation.        \nPassport photograph of a typical Cura?aoan:Photo: \nImage: Vincent Jong Tjien Fa\nCura?ao, best known for the deep blue liqueur of the same name produced here, is the largest of the three so-called ABC islands in the South Caribbean Sea including Aruba and Bonaire. The islands are part of the Netherlands Antilles and as such form an autonomous part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is believed that Curacao was named after the Portuguese \"cora??o\" for heart, referring to the island\u2019s heart shape. Today, Cura?ao has a population of over 140,000 living in an area of 444 sq km (171 sq miles). \nCura?ao\u2019s oldest inhabitants are supposed to have come from what is today Venezuela around 2500 BCE. These Amerindians were hunters and gatherers who used simple tools carved from stone and shells. Their remains were found at Cura?ao\u2019s oldest archeological site, the limestone terraces behind the airport. A group of these inhabitants migrated to Bonaire around 1500 BCE.\nConnecting the world daily with Cura?ao \u2013 or vice versa?Photo: \nImage: Michael Condouris\nAround 500 CE, another group of settlers arrived from the mainland, the Caiquetios Indians, farmers and hunters who introduced rabbits and deer to the island. It is believed that they crossed the 17 miles of open sea from the Paraguana peninsula in Venezuela in wooden canoes.    \nAmerindian family as drawn by John Gabriel Stedman in 1818: Photo: \nImage: Geheugen van Nederland \nThe Caiquetios lived in small villages made up of pole huts and knew how to make ceramic vessels. Ornaments made of shell, stone and bone were also found during archeological digs. Their cave paintings and rock art are still preserved today. The Caiquetios spoke a language called Arawak, a term also used to describe the indigenous Latin-American population encountered by Christopher Columbus and later explorers.   \nCura?ao\u2019s location north of Venezuela and south of the Dominican Republic: Photo: \nImage: M. Minderhoud\nWhen the first Spanish explorers arrived in Cura?ao, probably during an expedition under the leadership of Alonso de Ojeda in 1499, the Caiquetios had lived peacefully on the island for one thousand years. Impressed by the tall statures of the Caiquetios, the Spanish dubbed Cura?ao \u201cla isla de los gigantos\u201d \u2013 island of the giants. The explorers soon discovered though that they had to deal with friendly and peaceful giants so that despite being outnumbered, they soon subdued all of the approximately 2,000 Caiquetios living on Cura?ao.\nAn Arawak woman as drawn by John Gabriel Stedman in 1818:Photo: \nImage: Geheugen van Nederland\nWith no gold to be found, the Spaniards soon lost interest in Cura?ao and around 1513, took most of the Indian population to either work in the sugar cane fields in Santo Domingo or to work in the mines in Hispa?ola (today\u2019s Dominican Republic and Haiti). They brought a few of the original Indians back in 1527 but most settled in what is now Sabaneta.  \nThat left Cura?ao with a good hundred years of peace but after the Spanish came the Dutch who claimed Cura?ao in 1634. They deported most of the few remaining Caiquetios, fearing them to be spies for the Spaniards. The Dutch soon discovered Cura?ao\u2019s deep, natural harbour and founded Willemstad here, the island\u2019s capital to this today. The city soon became an ideal spot for trade and commerce, with shipping and piracy flourishing. \nNot even 30 years later, life on the island hit a new humanitarian low, as the Dutch West India Company made Cura?ao a centre for the Atlantic slave trade from 1662 onwards. Slaves were brought to the island from Africa and from there shipped to South America and the Caribbean. Cura?ao became very affluent and boasted its new wealth with typical  Spanish- and Dutch-style colonial buildings, witnesses of the time even today. \nA former slave house, now a museum:Photo: \nImage: Technische Fred \nThe colourful d?cor of the houses, found in many colonial cities around the world, had a practical reason: As slaves could not read, let alone decipher addresses, they simply followed the colour codes of the houses. \nWillemstad with its famous row of colonial houses:Photo: \nImage: Jessica Bee \nThe 17th century saw the arrival of Sephardic Jews from the Netherlands and then Dutch Brazil who have had a significant cultural and economic influence on the island. In fact, the Jewish congregation in Cura?ao, though small, is the oldest active congregation in the Americas, dating back to 1651, and it supported early Jewish congregations in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Cura?ao synagogue, completed in 1732, is the oldest synagogue of the Americas that has been in continuous use.\nThe Mikve Israel-Emanual synagogue in Willemstad with a floor of sand:Photo: \nImage: Mingo Hagen\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were marked by the British, French and Dutch fighting over Cura?ao. The island changed ownership various times until 1815 when it finally fell into Dutch hands. This turbulent history is the reason why many residents of Cura?ao are fluent in four languages today: Spanish, the earliest language exported to the island; Dutch, brought by the next wave of explorers; English, brought by the British in the 18th century; and Papiemento, a Creole language derived from Portuguese or Spanish with influences from African languages, English and the Arawak native languages.\nThe Netherlands abolished slavery in 1863, almost exactly 200 years after it started on the island. With the island\u2019s main source of income gone, many of the immigrants left to look for more profitable shores or other islands. \nPicturesque now but then?

Actually colourless, it is the artificial bright blue colour that is the feature most associated with  the Cura?ao liqueur today.  \nThe famous Blue Cura?ao liqueur:Photo: \nImage: AlMare\nStill, the economic slump lasted more than 150 years until oil was discovered in 1914. The Royal Dutch Shell Company and the Dutch Government built an extensive oil refinery right at the site of the old slave-trade market at Asiento, symbolic of the changing times. Soon, the island provided ample employment opportunities that again attracted immigrants from surrounding islands, the mainland, Portugal and Lebanon.  \nThe Beit Chaim Bleinheim Jewish cemetery and the former Shell oil refinery:Photo: \nImage: Mingo Hagen\nDuring the economic boom of the early 20th century, immigrants came from as far as East and South Asia. During the years before and after World War II, many Ashkenazi Jews fled from Eastern Europe, especially Romania. \n Well connected with the world \u2013 container ship CFS Palamedes at the deep sea harbour:Photo: \nImage: We El \nBut all wasn\u2019t well as racial tensions between the Afro-Caribbean population and the European immigrants grew. Large-scale rioting and protests on May 30, 1969 fueled a social movement that resulted in more rights and greater influence over the political process for the Afro-Caribbeans.      \nEconomically, Cura?ao went through a slump again after the aging refinery was sold in the mid 1980s due to pressure over a lack of safety standards and resulting lawsuits. Trying to reinvent itself yet again, Cura?ao is now banking on tourism as one important source of income. \nMany inhabitants have emigrated to the Netherlands, hoping for better employment opportunities there. In return, many Dutch pensioners have switched their home country for the sunnier shores of Cura?ao. Immigration from surrounding Caribbean islands and Latin America has also taken place so that the population base is changing once again.    \nThe Youth Chess Club of Cura?ao:Photo: \nImage via chessbase\nThough according to Dutch records, the last true Indian is said to have died in Aruba around 1862, Cura?ao\u2019s Amerindian ancestry is not lost. For one, there are all the archeological sites, not yet open to visitors, working towards preserving the island\u2019s earliest cultural history. \nProud Cura?ao Little League players:Photo: \nImage: Kelly van der Kwast\nAnd often, this ancestral aspect of Cura?ao is staring visitors right in the face \u2013 in the form of the features of many native Cura?aoans who, despite having mixed ancestry, still carry prominent traits of their forefathers and -mothers many thousands of years later.   \nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
