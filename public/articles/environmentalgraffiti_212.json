The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has recommended that it be taken off the endangered list as no extinct species should appear on it. This beautiful, tawny colored cat is also known as a catamount, puma or mountain lion. Last seen in 1930, all other sightings have turned out to be South American cats released by people after being bought as pets. The eastern cougar had a range of 21 states, none of which it exists in now. In the 1700s and 1800s it was hunted, with bounties put on its head.\nPhoto: Ltshears\nThere is a little bit of hope, an asterisk if you might, after the news of the cougar's extinction. Scientists did a genetic study and believe that it is possible that it was wrongly classified as a subspecies of the western cougar. If that is the case, they could perhaps be reintroduced. But as it stands now, driven to extinction by hunting throughout its vast range, there is no longer an eastern cougar in the 21 eastern states. \nPhoto: Ltshears\n\u201cIt\u2019s extinct,\u201d said Mark McCollough, a wildlife biologist with the FWS\u2019s offices in Maine, referring to the official determination by his agency. \u201cBut it\u2019s not?\u201d he was asked. \u201cBut it\u2019s not,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cIt may well return to part of its range.\u201d \nSources: 1, 2","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"nature","title":"Cougar Declared Extinct in Eastern United States","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/thumbW4PpoO.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/animals/news-cougar-declared-extinct-eastern-states"}
