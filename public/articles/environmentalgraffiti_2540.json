The report measured cities on environmental impact, quality of life, and \u201cfuture proofing\u201d, or how well cities are addressing issues like biodiversity, climate change, and recycling.\nBradford, formerly known for the filth and waste products produced by the wool industry, scored very highly for its sustainable waste treatment program. A large amount of money is being invested in the program, and the city is very proud of its new product, recycled sludge.\nYorkshire Water's asset delivery manager Simon Gibb explains: \"A lot of the ¢G70m we're spending here has gone on a scheme which mixes sewage sludge with Bradford's green recycling waste in a huge cake,\" he says. \"We sow this with rye grass, whose roots destroy remaining pollutants, and the result is a rich soil compound which is excellent for 'green' landfill.\" \nAlthough Bradford scored the highest in the environmental section of the study, its scores on quality of life meant it didn\u2019t rank top of the overall table. Brighton and Hove took the honors as overall best. \nSource: The Guardian\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Mill Town Turnaround","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb24.webshots.com-44055-2359028470104181437S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/mill-town-turnaround/344"}
