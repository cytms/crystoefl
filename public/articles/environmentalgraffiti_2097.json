They call him Pomi (Penguin Robot for Multimodal Interaction).\nScientists at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute in South Korea created Pomi; a robot that can see, hear, touch and make faces. One of the most fascinating features is that Pomi can actually emit smells, meaning that if you piss him off he might decide to fart near you.\nThis marks a huge leap for robotics: not very long ago, a robot was made in Europe that could imitate humans\u2019 capacity to walk on two legs. Pomi on the other hand, can make facial expressions according to his moods: he can move his eyebrows and pupils, as well as his lips. \nAll of this is made possible by an array of technologies including sensors, that allow Pomi to recognize voices and locate people. Even more incredible is the fact that Pomi is capable of producing various heartbeats, which are correlated to his mood.\nSouth Korean scientists developed Pomi after creating two other animal robots: Kobie the koala and Rabie the rabbit.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
