A historian of sciences at the Smithsonian\u2019s Natural History Museum and co-founder of the Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions, Touwaide has amassed a giant digital database featuring thousands of plant-based remedies recorded by physicians and literati in the ancient Mediterranean world.\nBut it is one thing to know that people wrote about these treatments, and quite another to confirm that they took or prescribed them. For much of Touwaide\u2019s career, no archaeological evidence of medicines from antiquity had been identified, creating an inherent dilemma. \u201cThe information that you have in a text is always exposed to the risk of being only theoretical,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd so until you have physical evidence of what you have in the texts, you never know if what you are working on has been used in ancient daily life and practice.\u201d\nThat changed in 2002, when Emanuela Appetiti, Touwaide\u2019s wife and research partner, read about a shipwreck discovered in the 1970s off the coast of Tuscany, dated to about 130 B.C. While excavating the trading ship\u2019s remains, archaeologists turned up various goods that may have originated in the Near East and Greece, an indication that the boat\u2019s ill-fated voyage began there; alternatively, it may have stocked up on cargo at an international market in Italy. They also found traces of a chest filled with what appeared to be medical supplies, including a bleeding cup, vials and tightly sealed tin containers, one of which was opened to reveal several tablets roughly the size of a quarter.\nAppetiti and Touwaide quickly sensed that the gray-green disks could be the elusive examples of ancient medicines they had been hoping to find. It took nearly two years and plenty of perseverance, but in 2004 they finally got their hands on two fragments of the tablets, which appeared to be made out of plant materials. They then enlisted the help of Robert Fleischer, a geneticist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Conservation Biology Institute, to identify the ingredients with DNA sequencing technology. \u201cFor the first time, we have a historian who knows ancient texts and a geneticist who was able to get the DNA out of these ancient things working so closely together,\u201d Touwaide said.\nFleischer\u2019s initial tests yielded results that Touwaide knew to be flawed. \u201cHe came up several times with lists of plants which were highly improbable because they were all plants traditionally thought to come from Asia or the New World,\u201d Touwaide explained. \u201cBut last August, he came up with a completely different list of plants because he used the most advanced DNA technology available.\u201d\nAt first glance, the list may seem more like a recipe for soup than a pharmaceutical formula. Indeed, the tablets are essentially 2,000-year-old bouillon cubes, composed of carrots, broccoli, leeks, cabbage, parsley, onions, radishes and other assorted plants and herbs. But for Touwaide, the fact that most of these items can be found in your average kitchen garden made perfect sense, and reflected the basic principles behind ancient remedies he had gleaned from countless texts.\n\u201cWhen you talk about ancient medicine, everybody thinks about exotic drugs: myrrh, incense, cloves\u2014all these kinds of things,\u201d Touwaide said. \u201cHere we have very simple stuff. That might have been surprising, but not for me.\u201d For early doctors such as Hippocrates, he explained, medicine and food were two sides of the same coin. \u201cIn all the writings attributed to Hippocrates, supposedly the father of medicine,?half of the formulas for medicines are made out of 45 plants, and these plants are indeed very common. For the Hippocratic physicians, medicine starts with what you eat and is an offshoot of alimentation.\u201d\nTouwaide pointed out that, their humble ingredients notwithstanding, the tablets suggest that people were producing sophisticated compound medicines\u2014remedies containing multiple ingredients\u2014earlier than previously thought. \u201cThere is a theory about compound medicine according to which they started mainly at the end of the first century B.C. and during the first century A.D.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here we have compound medicines dating back to between 140 and 120 B.C.\u201d In this way, then, archaeological evidence offered new clues about the timeline of medical history that textual sources have not yet provided.\nTouwaide\u2019s next step was to cross-reference Fleischer\u2019s list against the texts in his massive database, including classic works such as Dioscorides\u2019 \u201cDe Materia Medica.\u201d He found references to many of the tablets\u2019 components, including the clay that held them together, as possible treatments for dysentery and other gastrointestinal disorders, which are known to have plagued sailors at sea. Like the trading ship that sank off Tuscany, many ancient vessels might have carried medical kits designed to address these common ailments, Touwaide suggested. \u201cIt may also be the case that a physician was sailing with the crew, ready to intervene if necessary,\u201d he said.\nThanks to two tiny fragments of tablets hidden for two millennia under the sea, for the first time in his career Touwaide could verify that practice corresponded to the texts he had studied. But in his view, this does not necessarily mean that ancient physicians consulted manuscripts the way their contemporary equivalents might look up a drug in the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference. \u201cIt is traditionally believed that texts guided practice,\u201d he said. \u201cI suggest that it\u2019s the opposite\u2014that the texts are a record of practice. Practice was transmitted orally and sometimes written down.\u201d\nIn May, Touwaide and Appetiti traveled to Italy to present their findings, first at Rome\u2019s La Sapienza University and then at the Museo Archeologico del Territorio di Populonia in Tuscany, where the remains from the shipwreck are conserved. To their surprise, meeting with some of the divers who brought the ship to the surface helped them resolve an inconsistency in the DNA results. Fleischer had detected traces of sunflower, a plant thought to have only existed in the Americas until the 16th century. \u201cFortunately for us, one of the people who participated in the excavation told us that, before going underwater, they put the bottles of oxygen beside the place where they were living,\u201d Touwaide recalled. \u201cThis site was filled with sunflowers. So this presence of sunflower in our tablets might be the result of contamination.\u201d\nPerhaps most importantly, the trip to Tuscany gave Touwaide and Appetiti the opportunity to examine the artifacts found among the ship\u2019s remains, including the tin boxes containing the tablets. They also obtained additional samples that will help Fleischer confirm and expand his DNA analysis, as well as materials from the cache\u2019s mysterious vials that may turn out to be herbal products. Finally, they learned that x-rays of unopened boxes revealed the presence of a small perfume container, which Touwaide thinks may also prove relevant to his research. \u201cI suspect that ancient perfumes were more than just perfumes,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect they might have had some medical properties.\u201d\nTouwaide believes that a better understanding of the ship and its rare treasures might shed new light on life in the ancient Mediterranean world. If the medicines can be traced to the Near East, for example, a much more significant \u201cstream of exchanges\u201d between that region and Italy may have been taking place than is traditionally thought, he said, including the export of herbs and medicinal products to the Roman world. And further study of the tablets\u2019 ingredients and origin could also have implications for biodiversity, offering a clearer picture of the natural environment in antiquity. Because the plants used to make the tablets grew in many locations, Touwaide plans to pinpoint their geographical source by evaluating the clay binding them together and the tin used to make their containers.\nIn the longer term, Touwaide intends to promote DNA sequencing as a valuable tool for translating the often-invisible traces of biological products in archaeological remains into a snapshot of ancient people\u2019s behaviors, habits and experiences\u2014\u201cthe complete life,\u201d as he puts it. \u201cArchaeology will take on a new dimension, revealing information not otherwise available\u2014provided remains are not contaminated or cleaned and transformed into shiny showcase pieces,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough DNA, I would like to be able to precisely determine the diet of ancient populations around the Mediterranean, the substances they used for medicines and the substances they mixed to make perfumes and wines, among other things.\u201d\nAnd perhaps, he suggested, some of these findings will even influence modern pharmacology, which already owes a great debt to the medical knowledge of the past. \u201cAncient medical practice and its tradition will hopefully inspire innovation and help create the many medicines that are urgently needed,\u201d he said, adding that this is the guiding mission for his Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Ancient Medicines From Shipwreck Shed Light on Life in Antiquity","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/aquarium-artifacts.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/ancient-medicines-from-shipwreck-shed-light-on-life-in-antiquity"}
