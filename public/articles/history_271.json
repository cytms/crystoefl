Many doctors were skeptical of Brown-S?quard\u2019s outlandish claims, but he was hardly known as a quack. A pioneering expert on the spinal cord\u2019s physiology, he was held in high regard by the medical community. \nThroughout the summer of 1889, fantastic claims about the therapeutic benefits of Brown-S?quard\u2019s elixir generated front-page stories across the United States. \u201cOld Men Made Young,\u201d cried a St. Paul Daily Globe headline on August 10, 1889. \u201cOld Men Made as Frisky as the Friskiest Boys,\u201d blared The Boston Globe the next day. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that 70-year-old Fielden Weir, a former slave who\u2019d been crippled with rheumatism, was dancing and kicking both feet as high as his head just hours after receiving an injection. The demand for sheep\u2014used instead of guinea pigs by many American doctors\u2014was so high in Cincinnati that butchers couldn\u2019t keep pace.\nThe miraculous concoction was front-page news in Pittsburgh as well, and the reports would certainly have caught the attention of James Galvin, an aging pitcher for the city\u2019s National League baseball team. The 32-year-old right-hander was in the twilight of a brilliant professional career that began in 1875. Nicknamed \u201cPud\u201d because he made \u201cpudding\u201d of opposing batters, he\u2019d  already twirled two no-hitters and become baseball\u2019s first 300-game winner. (\u201cPudding\u201d would also have aptly described the physique of the short, stocky hurler.) In an era far removed from today\u2019s five-man pitching rotations, Galvin generally started every other game for his teams. In both 1883 and 1884, he won 46 games for Buffalo\u2019s National League franchise. \nGalvin displayed such incredible stamina and longevity that he was also called the \u201cLittle Steam Engine.\u201d But by 1889 the engine was sputtering, and the veteran player yearned to regain the pinnacle of his powers. And so on August 12, Galvin received an experimental injection of Brown-S?quard\u2019s potion at the Western Pennsylvania Medical College, The Washington Post reported.\nThe Washington Post was not shy in crediting Brown-S?quard for the comeback: \u201dIf there still be doubting Thomases who concede no virtue in the elixir, they are respectfully referred to Galvin\u2019s record in yesterday\u2019s Boston-Pittsburgh game. It is the best proof yet furnished of the value of the discovery.\u201d\nIf the injection enhanced Galvin\u2019s performance, a placebo effect was surely at work: Brown-S?quard\u2019s solution proved to be a medical fad without any therapeutic benefits. Still, by the end of 1889 more than 12,000 physicians had administered the elixir. Whether Galvin ever tried it again before the end of his baseball career is unknown. \nPud Galvin retired in 1892 with 365 victories and nearly 6,000 innings pitched. At that time he was baseball\u2019s all-time leader in wins, innings pitched, games started, games completed and shutouts. His fame did not bring fortune, however. The star pitcher died penniless in 1902 at age 47. \nThe following year, Cy Young surpassed Galvin on the all-time wins list. Galvin still ranks sixth in all-time victories and second in complete games and innings pitched, but his name has largely faded into the annals of baseball history. In 1965 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame\u2014an honor that has eluded some of the players who followed in his dubious footsteps.
