Scientists activated the gene that makes male structures develop in the body, but only turned it on in the brain.\nThe result was worms that \u201clook like girls, but act and think like boys,\u201d according to Jamie White, a researcher on the study.  \nThe study supports the idea that sexual orientation is the result of the brain\u2019s wiring. Erik Jorgensen, scientific director of the Brain Institute at the University of Utah, said the study \u201csuggests sexual behavior is encoded in our genes.\u201d\nNot everyone agrees with Jorgensen, and even he admits the study is not likely to fully explain human sexual orientation. Though worms and humans share much of the same dna, the complexity of the human brain means the study couldn\u2019t possibly answer all the questions on our sexuality. \nThe origins of human sexual orientation have yet to be adequately explained. Scientists argue theories from hormones and genetics to environment. \n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"science","title":"Scientists Create Lesbian Worms","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/PIA15283jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/scientists-create-lesbian-worms/381"}
