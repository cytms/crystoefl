It\u2019s not clean and it\u2019s not pretty. Well, it wasn\u2019t until artist Adrian Kondratowicz designed and produced a range of colorful trash bags which have decorated the streets of New York since May this year.\nPart of a viewer generated public art installation, entitled TRASH:anycoloryoulike; the artists roam select Manhattan streets and replace standard bags of trash with new beautified bags which are 100 percent biodegradable and scented to repel insects and vermin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a basic concept. We consider ourselves so advanced but we still throw our trash on the street,\u201d says Renee Mlynaryk, print and online media press coordinator for TRASH. \u201cIt has a progressive tone.\u201d\nThe premise of the installation is to raise public awareness of the arts within the environment and everyone is invited to take part. Individuals can buy their own bags; contribute by getting their whole block involved, the local school, or by creating their very own design.\nTRASH: anycoloryoulike is set to run through fall 2008 but if public reaction is anything to go by then maybe NYC will be seeing more bright-pink and white polka-dot garbage bags in the future. Anyone keen to get involved should check out their site.\nSource 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
