Instead, the next morning, he noticed what his sister calls a casing, ten feet long, and \"as smooth as an egg.\"  \nObviously emotionally disturbed,  Mr. Urmatov lawyered up, and filed suit.  Roskosmos, for its part, doesn't believe it did anything to merit this treatment-- they warn residents of a launch in advance, and pay damages if fallen chunks of their work hit anything.  So why not merely pay the man and move on?\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
