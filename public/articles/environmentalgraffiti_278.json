They wait for their prey \u2013 usually fish, birds or mammals of any size \u2013 by lurking in the water, often being mistaken for a piece of driftwood. Once the fish or land animal comes close, that\u2019s it. With a great big swoosh, they can leap to great heights as they rush out to attack, kill and devour. Yum!\nUsually, crocodiles appear pretty lazy, seemingly just lying around in the sun all day. But once on the prowl for something edible, these heavyweights become surprisingly agile, even though the largest of them can be almost 5 m (16.5 ft) long and weigh up to 1,200 kg (2,600 lb). \nPhotographer Marcus S?dervall followed this crocodile around at Hartley\u2019s Creek Crocodile Farm in Queensland, Australia. \nLying in wait\u2026Photo: Marcus S?dervall\n\u2026 spotting something\u2026Photo: Marcus S?dervall\n\u2026 and leaping is almost one move:Photo: Marcus S?dervall\nWhen really interested in something \u2013 like the bait in the picture below \u2013 crocodiles can stand fully erect on their hind legs. And that\u2019s quite an impressive sight as this saltwater crocodile snapped in the Adelaide River in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory proves. Don\u2019t miss the water swirling around its legs! \nPhoto: Gabriele Delhey\nAn interesting fact is that crocodiles swallow stones for digestion. With them, they either crush the food in their stomach \u2013 similar to grinding stones \u2013 or use them as ballast to balance out their body.  Talk about feeling heavy! Here are some more incredible images of crocs jumping \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t want to be at the receiving end of any of these!\nPhoto: R. Walker\nDon\u2019t miss the reflectionPhoto: R.

In fact, they are more closely related to them and to birds than to most reptiles! Given their stamina throughout the ages, the current number of crocodiles is estimated at between 200,000 to 300,000 worldwide, thus, they are at low risk of extinction. However, saltwater crocodiles especially are still sought after for their hides and illegal hunting as well as habitat loss are problems facing them.\nNext, a beautiful sequence from photographer Gillian McLaughlin of a very hungry crocodile in Darwin, Australia:\nPhoto: Gillian McLaughlin\nPhoto: Gillian McLaughlin\nPhoto: Gillian McLaughlin\nThe crocodile in the picture below is attacking a wildebeest while it is crossing the Mara River in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley with its herd. Here\u2019s a close-up of the incredible lunge:\nPhoto: Lip Kee\nPhoto: Lip Kee\nThose rooting for the wildebeest will be happy to know that they escaped unharmed. Though incredibly quick, the crocodile was a bit too slow.  \nAnd mind you, things started so harmlessly. This is the prelude to the dramatic image on top \u2013 can you spot the croc?\nPhoto: Lip Kee\nSources: 1, 2, 3","author":"Simone Preuss","web_category":"nature","title":"Crocodiles Leaping from the Water Caught on Camera","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/iStock000012192516Smalljpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/animals/news-crocodiles-leaping-water-pics"}
