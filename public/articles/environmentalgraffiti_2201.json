If you missed that article, check it out here.  Today we travel back billions of years to a time when the Earth was young and volcanoes ruled the world.\nAn Explosion of Heat\nVolcanoes have fascinated mankind for centuries.  The ancients held the explosions of molten rock and gases to be the work of the gods. Johannes Kepler, the legendary astronomer, believed them to be the Earth\u2019s tear ducts.\nThe early planet was covered in volcanoes.  These volcanoes had a major effect on earth and helped to create the atmosphere and possibly even complex life forms.\nAlthough today we think of greenhouse gases as an evil that must be stopped, in Earth\u2019s early days these gases allowed the planet to develop the conditions to support life.\nThe sun did not shine as brightly 4.5 billion years ago as it does today. The early sun was about 25% less bright than our own shining star.  Without the heat of a brighter sun, the Earth needed something else to ensure it wasn\u2019t just a gigantic frozen rock.  Enter volcanic blasts.\nThe Early Atmosphere\nOur atmosphere today contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen.  The early atmosphere was quite different, and contained far more greenhouse gases than we could stand today. Volcanoes helped create the warm Earth with their eruptions, which shot a mix of water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrochloric acid, methane, ammonia, nitrogen, & sulfur gases into the atmosphere.\nThose emissions did two things for the Earth. All that water vapor the volcanoes were spewing eventually condensed and formed the oceans that covered the earth.  All those greenhouse gases kept the Earth warm enough for the planet not to turn into an icicle, for a while at least.  Water stays warm and on the surface, and all of a sudden there\u2019s life.\nOnce there was water, life was possible. Nobody really knows how life started on the planet, but there is a volcano based theory.  Many scientists believe amino acids, the building blocks of life, arrived on the planet after collisions with meteors. These amino acids, however, need to combine into peptides, a protein that forms the basis of cells, before life is possible.\nOne theory of how peptides were created deals with undersea volcanoes.  Scientists at the Scripp\u2019s Research Institute in California showed that carbonyl sulfide, a common volcanic gas, helps amino acids form peptides.  They theorized that undersea volcanic eruptions could have spurred peptide formation and resulted in the first proto-life forms. Of course, this could all be wrong. It\u2019s one of like 10,000 origin of life theories. Moving on, life now exists in a very very simple form, cyanobacteria.\nCyanobacteria, one of the earliest life forms, swimming around in earth\u2019s nice warm oceans, sucking up carbon and shooting out oxygen. There\u2019s a problem, though. All that oxygen, which should be up in the atmosphere, is nowhere to be found. Something is sucking it all up.\nIt\u2019s volcanoes again.  This time they both helped and hindered life, albeit at different periods. For a long time, most of the volcanoes in the world were underwater. Underwater volcanic eruptions differ in some significant ways from above ground eruptions. The lower temperatures of underwater eruptions mean that magma chills quickly and produces gases like hydrogen sulfide which suck up available oxygen. This would take all the nice oxygen out of the air. But a coming shift in the location of Earth\u2019s volcanoes might rectify all that.\nAbove ground volcanoes release gases that can stay hot and don\u2019t end up sucking all the oxygen out of the environment.  When large continents began to form, more volcanoes were above ground than below. Shortly after this period, atmospheric oxygen levels began to rise. After the Earth\u2019s oxygen levels rose, we started seeing more and more of something truly miraculous; complex life.\n\nOur next article in The Mother Earth Series, \u201cFrom Noxious Fumes to a Breath of Fresh Air\u201d will explore the atmosphere of the early earth in greater detail.
