Borders were shut, authorities suggested we didn\u2019t fly to countries already infected with the disease and hospitals prepared with equipment normally saved for outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus. It was big news.\nToday, although the threat is no longer of critical, the virus is still present, waiting in the wings for its chance to have 15 minutes of fame.
