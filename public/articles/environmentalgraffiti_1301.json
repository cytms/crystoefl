Then Vatican City edged out Monaco in one of the closest matches in Environmental World Cup history. We rounded out the European qualifiers with San Marino knocking out Malta. We\u2019ve been in the island rounds for the last three weeks, with Tuvalu taking out Nauru and Barbados beating Grenada on penalty kicks. The Seychelles took out the Maldives in a squeaker of a match. Finally, Palau beat St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  We began the second round recently, with the Vatican City easily dispatching Antigua and Barbuda.  Liechtenstein laid a bit of a smackdown on Tuvalu, and then San Marino beat the Seychelles. Last week Palau got by Barbados to make the semis. \n\nThis week we\u2019ll see two European nations take each other on as San Marino meets Liechtenstein. It\u2019s the first Europe vs. Europe match since the first round, and Europe\u2019s chance to win the cup may hang in the balance. \n San Marino starts with the ball. San Marino won a resounding victory in the first round over Malta in the first round then squeaked by the Seychelles in the quarterfinals. \nSan Marino is a mountain republic. I don\u2019t mean they have a lot of mountainous areas there, I mean the whole country is literally on the side of a single mountain, Mount Titano, surrounded by Italy. \nIt was founded by a Christian monk attempting to escape Roman persecution in 301 and its 1600 constitution is the oldest in the world that\u2019s still in effect, helping their claim to be the oldest constitutional republic in the world. They\u2019ve had a lot of powerful fans over the years, including honorary citizen Abraham Lincoln and Napoleon, who didn\u2019t conquer it because he thought the country was awesome the way it was. \nThe San Marino government has a Ministry of State for Territory, Environment, and Agriculture. The main environmental issue facing the country is urbanization. It\u2019s kind of hard to farm on a mountain, although people manage to, and the government has claimed that global warming has made it even harder. The urban areas are growing quicker than originally anticipated. This has led to inadequate basic facilities for some of the population. It has also led to most of the land being built up, rather than used for agriculture as it was previously. There are no endangered species in San Marino, mostly because very few animals live on the sides of mountains.\nLiechtenstein trashed Andorra in the first round before beating Tuvalu by a point in the second. Liechtenstein is a tiny European principality nestled between the alpine states of Austria and Switzerland. \nThe country has a healthy tourist industry, with plenty of \u201cresidents\u201d who live in the country as a tax haven. There are also more registered companies in the nation than people. It\u2019s been very active in environmental policy. It passed the 1933 Nature Conservation Act, the 1957 Water Conservation Act, and air pollution laws in both 1973 and 74. Every bit of wastewater produced by the country is purified, which has helped keep the Rhine, into which the water is dumped, cleaner. \nIt does have some issues with greenhouse gas emissions. Liechtenstein has a higher CO2 emission rate per capita, at 7.5 tons of CO2 per person per annum, than Switzerland, Croatia, and several other larger countries.  \nFinal Score: Liechtenstein-2 San Marino-1\nLiechtenstein has been more active in trying to fix their environmental problems, although San Marino is close. Liechtenstein\u2019s slight edge gives it the win. \n... If you'd like to keep up with the rest of the series, why not subcribe to our RSS feed?.
