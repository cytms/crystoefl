As summer draws nearer and the days grow longer, it\u2019s only natural to start daydreaming of summer barbecues, picnics and downtime. And the glow of a firefly is a requisite symbol of the lazy, hazy days and nights of summer. To be honest, I\u2019d never really thought about it myself, but the answer is positively fascinating. So how do fireflies glow? Turns out it\u2019s not quite so magical after all, since it\u2019s the product of a complex chemical reaction going on inside their bodies.\n?\nYou see, fireflies contain a chemical in their abdomen called luciferin. When that chemical combines with oxygen and with an enzyme called luciferase, the ensuing chemical reaction causes their abdomen to light up. This light is referred to as bioluminescence, which is when a chemical light is produced by a reaction within a living organism. Most commonly seen on dry land in the glow of a firefly, bioluminescence is actually far more common under the sea in many species of fungi, fish and other marine wildlife. Bioluminescence is a \u201ccold light\u201d\u2014 it doesn\u2019t produce any heat, like the light from a light bulb, for instance. And it\u2019s a good thing too, because if a firefly produced heat along with its glow, it wouldn\u2019t be able to survive.\n?\nSo why do fireflies glow in the first place? The answer to that is the same as the answer to the question of why some men wear so much darn cologne. To attract the ladies, of course! (But far more successfully than the men with the cologne.) Most of the time, at dusk, when you see fireflies buzzing around flashing lights all around you, they\u2019re actually male fireflies doing most of the flashing. That\u2019s because they\u2019re trying to \u201cshow off\u201d for the ladies of their own species. There are more than 2,000 species of firefly. A male firefly will light up its abdomen at a particular rate or wavelength, and when a female firefly sees a male from her own species shining in that particular way, she\u2019ll respond with her own light. Hence baby fireflies are conceived.\n?\nAnother reason fireflies glow (and this one not quite as romantic) is to lure prey. Some females will glow to lure a male to her and then \u2014 chomp! \u2014 he becomes dinner.?\n?\nThe final reason that fireflies glow is to deter predators. Fireflies are filled with chemicals called lucibufagins, which is hard to say and even harder to swallow \u2014 they taste terrible. When a predator tastes a firefly, it learns to associate the glow with the bad taste. So the firefly\u2019s glow actually warns would-be predators to stay away.\n?\nThere you have it, folks. Something so simple and magical as a lightning bug\u2019s glow broken down into all its not-so-magical component parts. Then again, that makes it kind of magical, right?
