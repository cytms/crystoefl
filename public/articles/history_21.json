What scientists did know is that agriculture had come later to this area along the Lower Yangtze River than elsewhere in China and much of the rest of the world\u2014rice crops first took root around 2,500-2,000 B.C. and archeologists believed it quickly became the region\u2019s staple crop. Today, more than 70 percent of the world\u2019s rice production occurs in subtropical China.\nEager to learn more about the early diet of Xincun, researchers turned to a new technique, known as ancient starch analysis. This allowed them to extract sediment from grinding stones used to process food around 3,350 B.C., hundreds of years before rice was first grown in the there. The samples, tested in both the United Kingdom and China yielded some surprising results. Researchers had expected to find examples of starches from plants indigenous to the region, such as water chestnuts and lotus and fern roots, but were shocked when the sediment also turned up starches from other plants, including bananas, tubers and subtropical palms. Palm starch, which is extracted from its trunk, then ground up, dried and used as flour, has been a reliable source of nutrients for thousands of years. It may not taste great, but it can be grown year round in the right conditions. There is little evidence, however, of it being a cultivated crop in ancient times. It has historically been eaten by nomadic groups who, once they have exhausted the plant source in one area, move onto the next\u2014as is still the case today with transient tribes in Borneo and Indonesia.\nThe residents of Xincun, however, were a sedentary society, so their continued consumption of palms over a long period of time likely means that they cultivated the plant nearby, making it the region\u2019s first agricultural crop. According to the University of Leicester\u2019s Dr. Huw Barton, a co-author of the study, residents of Xincun and surrounding areas did eventually adopt rice as their primary crop, but with palms and other foodstuffs at their disposal, it probably happened at a much slower pace than in regions without an established, indigenous agricultural base. Barton, who compared the study\u2019s unlikely findings to \u201chitting the jackpot,\u201d believes that the new evidence indicates \u201cthat there was something much more interesting going on in the subtropical south of China 5,000 years ago than previously thought.\u201d Barton\u2019s team hopes to continue its work in other settlements along the coast of China.","author":"Barbara  Maranzani","web_category":"news","title":"Ancients First Ate Palms, Not Rice","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HITH-Palm.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/ancients-ate-palms-not-rice"}
