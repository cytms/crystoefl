The city will receive five buses run on hydrogen fuel cells and another five with traditional engines that burn hydrogen. London has almost 8,000 buses in service, and the city has used diesel hybrids for years in an effort to reduce pollution.\nThe buses are almost 8 times more expensive than traditional diesel buses, which cost around ¢G130,000. However, the city feels the environmental benefits outweigh the cost. The buses\u2019 only emission is water vapor, whereas diesel buses can be heavy polluters. The city hopes that the cost of hydrogen-powered buses will drop as they become more commonly used.\nLivingstone said: \u201cLondon is now the first city in Europe to commit to a hydrogen bus fleet of this size, which will match traditional diesel buses in terms of performance.\u201d\n\u201cThis represents a huge step forward from the previous hydrogen trials in the capital and is an important step towards my target of having five per cent of all public sector fleet vehicles powered by hydrogen by 2015.\u201d\nSource: Reuters\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"environmentgreen-tech","title":"Coming Soon to London: Hydrogen-Powered Buses","picture_url":"/sites/default/files/images/13383739111759806847.jpg","url":"http://www.techgraffiti.com/news-coming-soon-london-hydrogen-powered-buses"}
