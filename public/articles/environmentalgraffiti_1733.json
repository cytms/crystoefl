Billed as an \u201cinteractive multimedia pile-up\u201d, this free, non-corporate extravaganza didn\u2019t disappoint. In a city where more conventional art exhibitions are as commonplace as rats in biology labs, the work featured here leapt out like some orgiastic post-apocalyptic cybernetic experiment.\nHeld at Behind the Shutters Gallery, a multi-storey warehouse space in Shoreditch, MuTATE Britain showcased a gargantuan collection of cutting-edge contemporary art, including live performances, video art and 3D installations.\nPhoto: Mutoid Waste Co. installation \n\n\nPhenomenal specimens of sculpture were built using recycled objects such as vehicle parts and scrap metal, and some of the works were brought to life via robotics. Great graffiti art was also on show, and various artists \u2013 Inkie and Eelus to namedrop but two \u2013 were invited to do all kinds of aerosol, airbrush, acrylic and other pieces on titanium aircraft panels salvaged following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Here, as throughout the exhibition, a wry take on war came to the fore, and sex was never far from the picture.\nPhoto: Red Angel, by Wreckage International (Mutoid Waste Co.)\nMuTATE Britain was the brainchild of the Mutoid Waste Company, a travelling art collective spawned in the 1980s. They kick-started their career throwing illegal parties, where they transformed disused spaces like bus depots into other worldly environments with the sculptures and costumes they created. Influenced by sci-fi culture like the 2000AD comics and Mad Max films, Mutoid Waste became legendary for having the mettle to meddle with metal and other materials in ways that embodied brilliantly twisted imaginations.\nPhoto: Oopsy Daisy, by Eelus\nOne of the founders of Mutoid Waste, Joe Rush is no stranger to retrieving and reusing all conceivable discarded bits and pieces so that they take on outlandish new personas. The valkyrie-like Lady of the Lamp is a reworked tailors dummy of steel and cloth. Its name is a clear allusion to famous wartime nurse Florence Nightingale, but with its corseted hourglass figure it\u2019s immediately sexualised. The headlamp face of this surreal mannequin stares down at you \u2013 and stares you down \u2013 in a piece that plays on power.\nPhoto: Triumph Heart, by Joe Rush\nAnother piece by Joe Rush, Triumph Heart exposes the vein of quirky humour as well as rare beauty behind the mechanical madness of his work. Assembled out of lipstick red steel and chrome Triumph motorcycle parts, \u201cit\u2019s this classic image taken from Catholic kitsch iconography \u2013 the sacred heart of Jesus \u2013 and transposed to be literally triumphant,\u201d Eva Branscome pointed out.\nRush\u2019s sculptures have been cast is bronze and collected by such luminaries as Damien Hirst and Ted Baker \u2013 testimony to the fact that his underground credentials have kicked down the door for more widespread critical success.\nPhoto: Pole Dancers, by Giles Walker (Mutoid Waste Co.)\nAnother member of Mutoid Waste, Giles Walker is a whiz in animatronics \u2013 the use of electronics to make mechanised puppets seem alive. Like Joe Rush, Walker is now also an internationally recognised artist and exhibits worldwide. His robotic Pole Dancers, which he tours with, caused a sensation at MuTATE Britain.\nA megaphone-headed DJ flanks two pole-dancing girl robots watched by a heckling drunk in the audience, purported to be a self-portrait of the artist. The automatons are animated with 12-volt windscreen wiper motors and controlled via a PC \u2013 yet they move just like humans.\n\u201cThe pole dancers moved smoothly, seductively gyrating,\u201c observed Eva Branscome. \u201cThe fact that the heads are like a cross between CCTV cameras and search lights is also a reference to the illegal street art culture.\u201d A comment, too, on the way everyone is caught up in some kind of surveillance game, as the artist himself explains:\n\n\nPhoto: Tamara Pt 3, by Part2ism\nTaking off with themes parallel to other artists exhibiting at Mutate Britain, came acclaimed graffiti artist and music producer Part2ism with Tamara Pt 3. Not just a single aircraft panel but a whole section of aluminium aircraft wing was used for this giant aerosol and acrylic piece, which spanned two floors of the exhibition space. But let Eva Branscome, who collaborated on this article, have the last word \u2013 almost:\n\n\nStreet art from the outer reaches done good in this dirty great beast of an exhibition.\nAll images by: Emodern\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
