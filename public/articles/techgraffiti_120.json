It goes back to a 2001 patent that Motorola filed, exploring the use of photovoltaic cells behind the LED screen of the device, much like a calculator. If Apple pulled this off successfully, there would be no design modifications at all. It would be an instant success. But the question we have to ask ourselves is, could they actually pull it off? After all, Motorola tried and failed.\nMacRumors\u2019 claim that if Apple were to be successful, iPods and MacBooks could run without any mains charge is \u201cwildly optimistic,\u201d say PC pro. They did an experiment where they charged a MacBook all day long with 104 x 54cm solar panel, but the computer was only powered for two hours. Unless Apple have really got their shit together, their solar cells would only be able to power an iphone or ipod for a few minutes.\nApart from the limitations of the solar cell technology, another pressure is emerging: phones are constantly having new features added to them. Whether it\u2019s GPS, more RAM, higher megapixel cameras and so on, Apple\u2019s engineers have a mammoth task ahead of them.\nIf Apple can pull this one off soon, then I will be seriously impressed. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything in the near future though and I\u2019m placing this firmly in the rumors box.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
