JPAC sent bone casts to scientists at Louisiana State University, who used 3-D modeling techniques to create clay facial reconstructions of the unknown soldiers. Officials hope that these detailed images, unveiled today during the dedication of a memorial plaque, might finally put names to the remains as the 150th anniversary of the Monitor\u2019s demise approaches.\n\u201cThese are the faces of men who gave their lives for their country at a pivotal moment in American history,\u201d said David Alberg, superintendent of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary. \u201cThe best-case scenario is that someone will emerge, perhaps a descendent, who can give these faces a name.\u201d\nBy examining the hip bones of the Monitor sailors, scientists estimated that one of the men was between 17 and 24 years old, while the other was between 30 and 40, said Mary Manheim, director of Louisiana State University\u2019s Forensic Anthropology and Computer Enhancement Services (FACES) Laboratory. Next, imaging specialist Eileen Barrow placed tissue-depth markers on the two skulls to measure their contours before shaping features out of clay, Manheim said.\nFACES typically provides its services to law enforcement agencies, although it has occasionally worked on historical research projects. \u201cIt is so exciting to be a part of this,\u201d said Manheim. \u201cTo be able to participate in it is so rewarding. To be able to create images that may have looked like these people is even more rewarding.\u201d\nExperts think the two men might have died while trapped in the Monitor\u2019s revolving turret, one of the innovations that made the vessel so revolutionary when construction began in late 1861. On March 9, 1862, the Union ironclad faced off against the CSS Virginia (originally the CSS Merrimack) during the legendary Battle of Hampton Roads. Considered a watershed moment in both naval and Civil War history, the engagement ended in a standstill.\nNine months later, the Monitor made its way through rough waters en route to Beaufort, North Carolina, towed by the USS Rhode Island. The heavy, low-slung vessel had served well in the sheltered Chesapeake Bay but pitched and swayed on the open seas. As waves tossed the craft, the caulking around the gun turret loosened and water leaked into the hull. On December 31 the ironclad\u2019s pump stopped working, forcing its 62 crewmembers to abandon ship; it sank with 16 men still aboard.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"Faces of Drowned Civil War Sailors From USS Monitor Reconstructed","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/monitor-faces-150x150.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/faces-of-drowned-civil-war-sailors-from-uss-monitor-reconstructed"}
