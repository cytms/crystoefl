Some of the others showed signs that they too had been mounted in this manner, said Hallgren, who believes the Kanaljorden site contains the only known example of this practice from the Mesolithic era. \u201cMost historical examples pertain to colonial representatives mounting the skulls of murdered natives,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are also examples of indigenous people using skulls in various rituals, including both burial rituals and the display of trophies.\u201d\nThe site yielded another surprising find that adds to the mystery surrounding these ancient Swedes\u2019 unconventional entombment techniques: a female skull with another woman\u2019s temporal bone stuffed inside it. \u201cCould it be that they are close relatives\u2014perhaps a mother and daughter?\u201d Hallgren wondered. \u201cWe hope DNA analysis will give us the answer to this.\u201d Other noteworthy discoveries from the site include an elaborately decorated pickaxe made from an antler, bone points studded with flint and animal remains that likely had symbolic value.\nThe stakes could have been used for secondary burial rites, in which individuals\u2019 bones were removed from their graves and reinterred after their bodies decomposed, Hallgren said. At least one other Mesolithic site in Sweden bears traces of this tradition. \u201cWe believe the stakes were used for mounting, with the aim to display the skulls better during the complex ritual,\u201d said Hallgren. \u201cThe intact stake has a pointed end and was probably thrust into the ground\u2014or possibly a bed of embers, since there are slight traces of fire\u2014during a part of the ritual. The skulls were subsequently laid to rest at the bottom of the lake.\u201d\nAnother hypothesis about this macabre practice holds that the skulls belonged to enemies killed in combat, not departed loved ones whose mourners gave them two funerals. Perhaps, Hallgren said, victorious Stone Age warriors mounted the heads of their foes on stakes and carried them home from battle as war trophies. The researchers believe laboratory analysis of the remains might support or rule out this scenario. \u201cSulphur and strontium isotopes in the bones will give information on whether the skulls represent locals or come from a distant place, and DNA analysis will hopefully elucidate if the interred individuals are related or unrelated strangers,\u201d said Hallgren. \u201cThese data will give clues to if the depositions represent secondary burial rituals or trophies of defeated enemies.\u201d\nHallgren and his colleagues believe that nomadic bands of Mesolithic Swedes roamed the region\u2019s forests and shores 8,000 years ago, moving on a seasonal basis between summer and winter camps. \u201cThey were hunters and gatherers, and not least fishermen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe laboratory analysis of nitrogen and carbon isotopes in the human bones show that fish formed an important part of their diet. From the animal bones found at the site we know that they also hunted big forest game like wild boar, read deer, elk and brown bear.\u201d\nFor this far-flung population, Kanaljorden likely served as a sacred meeting spot, Hallgren said. \u201cWe interpret the site as a ritual place used by a group of hunter-gatherers that lived dispersed in the surrounding landscape for large parts of the year, but gathered at the rapids of the nearby river Motala Str?m for communal fishing of spawning fish during shorter periods,\u201d he explained. \u201cSuch gatherings were, we believe, the time for social interaction like arranging marriages, making offerings and burying the dead.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Human Skulls Mounted on Stakes Found at Stone Age Burial Site","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cranium-during-excavation-150x150.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/human-skulls-mounted-on-stakes-found-at-stone-age-burial-site"}
