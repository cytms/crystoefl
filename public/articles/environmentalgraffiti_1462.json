While she has so far immortalised stags, bears and even pigs\nin her sculptures, the horse is the star of the show when it comes to Heather\u2019s artistic creations.\nPhoto: Heather Jansch\nPhoto: Heather Jansch\nShe explains: \u201cFrom the beginning my twin passions were drawing and horses.\u201d Working with twisted and sea-worn pieces of driftwood from\nthe Devon coast, Heather gives them new life by painstakingly piecing each item together to not just represent the equine form but to embody it.\nJust as each horse has its own personality, so do each of Heather\u2019s horse sculptures and they are even named.\nPhoto: Heather Jansch\nHeather tries to work with each piece of wood as she finds it. Rather than sculpting it or making it fit, she prefers a more organic approach to art.\nTimber is often placed around a fibreglass-coated steel frame to hold it steady and fixed in place using stainless steel screws. This combination of materials means that the reincarnated animals have a longer lifespan than their living, breathing cousins.\nPhoto: Heather Jansch\nWhile not everyone will have space for a scale model of a horse or other large animal in their back garden, Heather says that some of her sculptures do indeed go to people\u2019s homes, although the majority are destined for public places.\nWhen Heather was training in art, she was asked to leave college. She explains: \u201cI was told I did not have the stuff painters were made\nfrom.\u201d While Heather\u2019s painting was accurate and detailed, it didn\u2019t seem to\nfit within the trend for what she describes as \u201csquare green canvases with\ntriangles and circles with bold, clashing colours.\u201d But she\u2019s gone on to prove her teachers wrong. Who needs bold, clashing colours when nature can provide everything for a magnificent work of art?\nWith thanks to Heather Jansch for her kind permission to use images and details from her website.","author":"JaneK","web_category":"art+and+design","title":"Amazing Driftwood Sculptures","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/incredible-pencil-art.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/art/news-driftwood-reincarnated-life-size-art"}
