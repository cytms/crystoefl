TalLight and shadow over the Mediterranean\nCloud gazing is a great way to pass one\u2019s time and there are few who haven\u2019t stopped to look up at a particular stunning cloud formation. Seen from above, clouds not only form whitish soft blankets; they also create amazing patterns with their shadows.  \nA cloud blanket over the sea:Photo: Joi Ito\nTechnically, a shadow is the reverse projection of an object blocking a light source, usually the sun. Depending on the time of day and the distance of the object from the light source, a shadow\u2019s length will vary. For moving objects \u2013 like clouds \u2013 their shadows will expand proportionally faster. According to western mythology and many early eastern beliefs, shadows, like halos, were seen as the representation of God's presence around an object.\nA carpet of soft clouds over Auckland, New Zealand:Photo: Newsbie Pix\nIn countries like China, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, shadow play or shadow puppetry has a long tradition. This ancient form of storytelling and entertainment made its way to Europe in the 18th century through French missionaries, who brought back the equipment and technique and put on popular shows back home. Little did they know that all they\u2019d have to do is simply gaze at cloud shadows and weave tales out of their ever shifting shapes!      \nCloud shadow play over the Mediterranean:Photo: Michele Molinari\nThe continents replicated by clouds, somewhere over the Atlantic:Photo: Miguel303xm\nTwin clouds and their shadows over Cayuga Lake, NY:Photo: Kris Arnold\nSometimes, clouds and their shadows seem to put in a lot of effort to supplement existing geographical formations or to replicate their shapes.\nClouds imitating the Western Australian coastline:Photo: 29cm\nClouds bridging the Pacific:Photo: Mila Zinkova\nCloud shadows competing with lakes in the Catskills:Photo: Kris Arnold\nAt other times, one wonders if clouds know about the dots and dashes of Morse code and try to tell us something.  \nDoes this spell SOS or I Love You?Photo: Jessica Spengler\nDots and dashes as far as the eye can see:Photo: SpecialKRB\nClouds trying to spell out something over Arizona:Photo: Jessica Reeder\nMorse code somewhere over Australia:Photo: Jessica Spengler\nClouds, always majestic and often threatening, do have their playful side too. Like giant pawns made of cotton they seem to use the landscape as one gigantic playing board.\nChinese checkers and cotton balls somewhere in the Midwest:Photo: Jessica Spengler\nThe gods\u2019 playing board:Photo: Jessica Spengler\n \nWe could do this for the rest of the day but we have yet to figure out a way to get paid for cloud gazing.
