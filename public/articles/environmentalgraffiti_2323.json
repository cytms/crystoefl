That may be true in some cases, but if you\u2019re looking to abandon inefficient and wasteful habits and live a greener, more environmentally responsible life, there are lots of small, easy changes you can make that will have an immediate positive impact starting first thing tomorrow morning. For instance \u2026\nA Greener MorningPhoto: Matt Seppings\nWhen you open those sleepy eyes and roll out of bed, avoid turning on lights as much as possible (make sure the ones you do switch on are energy-efficient) by opening shades or blinds to allow any available natural light into the room. The human eye is more than capable of adjusting to low-light situations, and after a few minutes you will be expertly navigating the familiar surroundings of your living space.\nPhoto: baileyraeweaver\nCarry out your normal morning routine by using as little water/energy as possible: turn off the faucet when brushing your teeth; take shorter, cooler showers; let your hair dry naturally; and flush the toilet less frequently. Before leaving the house, adjust your thermostat for minimal energy use while you\u2019re away. Grab a locally grown piece of fruit or an organic breakfast bar, and you\u2019re day is off to a great green start.\nStay Strong at WorkPhoto: mscaprikell\nHowever you make a living \u2014 in the office, on the road, in the field, etc. \u2014 there are ways to cut down on waste and emissions during the course of your daily workday. For those who work in an office setting, improve efficiency and reduce your footprint by adjusting your computer\u2019s energy-saving settings; changing your screensaver to a solid black screen; setting your printer preferences to two-sided printing; and turning off and unplugging your computer and peripheral hardware (scanners, printers, speakers, etc.) at the end of your shift. If your job requires you to travel locally or extended distances, keep your negative environmental impact low by checking for proper tire pressure and other simple maintenance; removing unnecessary weight from your trunk or truck bed; and limiting excessive speeding, stopping, starting and idling.\nPhoto: seantoyer\nBe conscious of other changes you can make specific to your occupation, like carpooling, public transit, telecommuting, or adding plants to your workspace to inspire and motivate yourself and those around you.\nAt-Home HabitsPhoto: Hammer51012\nOnce you\u2019re off the clock and back in the comfort of your own home, you can continue to make small but effective changes to achieve a greener home life. Use locally grown ingredients in your meals if possible, and use less energy by eating salads, vegetables and other raw produce. Designate an empty cardboard box as an impromptu recycling bin, and look up local recycling drop-off centers in your area. Keep your lights off by using eco-friendly soy candles once the sun goes down, and unplug any appliances you don\u2019t plan on using for the rest of the night. Settle in with a good book or an energy-efficient laptop, and congratulate yourself on your first day as a responsible member of a greener society. Then be sure to make a personal vow to do it all over again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next ...\nCommit, Conserve and ContinuePhoto: charlesstarrett\nThe biggest key to living greener is vigilance \u2014 you have to actively embrace these changes and be conscious of the impact your daily decisions and actions have on the environment and well-being of the planet and all its inhabitants.
