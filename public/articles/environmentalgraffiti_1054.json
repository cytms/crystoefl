The number of young fish has increased though, and the report calls for a 50% reduction of 2006 fishing numbers rather than a complete ban. \nThe report attributes the increase in the number of young fish to a decrease in fishing pressures as a result of government constraints on fishing levels.\nIt warns that unless restraints on the number of fish collected and illegal catches are continued, the fish population may start dropping again.\nSource: BBC\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Great Cod Almighty","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Nile-perch.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/great-cod-almighty/345"}
