We are able to tell more specific ages of children as those relate closely to the widths of the flutings, but adults are too variable.\u201d\nVan Gelder and Sharpe also found that clear finger profiles\u2014the shapes of the top edges of the fingers\u2014allowed them to determine the gender of certain flutings\u2019 creators. Based on this system, they concluded that women and children were responsible for many of the flutings at Rouffignac. They also attributed some of the tectiforms to fluters under 7, detecting \u201cthe first known instance of prehistoric children engaging in symbolic figure-making,\u201d said Cooney.\nEarlier this year, Cooney accompanied Van Gelder to the caves and took detailed measurements, hoping to deepen our understanding of the flutings and the prehistoric people who made them. She will present her findings on Sunday at the annual conference of the Society for the Study of Childhood in the Past, which began September 30 in Cambridge, England. More than anything else, Cooney, a doctoral candidate, hopes her research will shed light on perceptions of childhood in Paleolithic societies. \u201cWhat I wanted to do with my Ph.D. was to allow prehistoric children to have a voice, since children are rarely talked about in academic discourse,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found in Rouffignac is that they are screaming to be heard\u2014the presence of children is everywhere in the cave, even in the passages furthest from the entrance.\u201d\nIndeed, Cooney and Van Gelder identified children\u2019s flutings in nearly every chamber of the complex, including its most remote reaches, accessible after a 45-minute hike through cramped, rocky tunnels pitted with dens where long-extinct cave bears once hibernated. One cavern in particular featured so many children\u2019s flutings that Cooney described it a \u201cplaypen,\u201d suggesting that it was a special place reserved for young people\u2019s recreation or rituals.\nOut of the thousands of flutings on Rouffignac\u2019s surfaces, most measurable examples were made by a small group of eight to 10 people, Cooney and Van Gelder determined. Four of these prolific individuals appear to have been children between the ages of 2 and 7, Cooney said. The most enthusiastic fluter was likely a girl around 5 years old, whose work covers more surface area than that of any other Rouffignac artist. The archaeologists also found evidence that the primitive art form was likely an intergenerational collaboration. \u201cThere are no areas in Rouffignac with flutings where we find adults without children, and vice versa,\u201d Cooney explained. \u201cWe know that many of the children\u2019s flutings would have required two people\u2014probably an adult but not necessarily\u2014to make the flutings. Many of the children\u2019s flutings are about 2 meters [6.5 feet] high, so they would have had to be lifted.\u201d\nCooney explained that identifying the flutings\u2019 creators might bring us one step closer to understanding the art form\u2019s purpose and significance, but various possibilities are still in the running. \u201cWe can only speculate at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cMany theories about cave art point to shamanism or ritual use. While I don\u2019t rule that out, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s necessarily the case for all caves. With children involved, it could have been one of those reasons but also very likely could have been play or a time for practicing art, or simply an exploration of the landscape.\u201d Adults\u2019 contributions to children\u2019s artistic expression\u2014as teachers, helpers or simply proud parents\u2014could lend credence to this hypothesis.\nWhatever fluting represented, children\u2019s high level of participation in the activity suggests that boundaries between childhood and adulthood were more relaxed during the Stone Age than they are in the modern world, Cooney added. \u201cWhile we can really only talk authoritatively about the children of Rouffignac based on this evidence, I would say that it indicates that children were involved in most, if not all, aspects of Paleolithic life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems that there were limited age-based identities, and those who are considered children today may not have been considered children in the Paleolithic.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Prehistoric Children Finger-Painted on Cave Walls","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/flutings-closeup-150x150.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/prehistoric-children-finger-painted-on-cave-walls"}
