But it wasn\u2019t always like this.\nAround 4 billion years ago there was water on Mars, an essential ingredient for life. But why didn\u2019t life begin?\nWhen the little Mars rover came back from its long journey, it brought with it a mystery. The red planet had lots and lots of rocks on it which were made up of 8-10% sulphur, but no limestone.\nNow, if anyone remembers their carbon cycle they\u2019ll know that as silicate rocks remove CO2 from the atmosphere it turns into limestone, in the presence of water. We know there was water, but there isn\u2019t any limestone. Weird.\nScientists?discovered that Mars' atmosphere?lacked oxygen?and carbon dioxide,?therefore in order for there not to have been any limestone,?the gaseous atmosphere may have been?sulphur dioxide - a greenhouse gas, produced?by volcanoes. On Earth our sulphur dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by oxidation, which is what led scientists to formulate that there?were and still are?vast quantities of?sulphur?present on?\"the red planet,\" due to the fact that atmospheric sulphur dioxide wasn\u2019t oxidised by oxygen.\nAs vast quantities of the greenhouse gas, Sulphur dioxide were present, Mars may have had a climate and been warmer than today.?Logically, it must have smelled rotten (rotten eggs to be precise) thanks to all that sulphur. So perhaps the reason life didn\u2019t begin on Mars was that it just smelled too bad, and as this was life\u2019s first appearance in the solar system it wasn\u2019t going to begin until it could be sure that it smelled sweet.\nIf you want to find out all the latest life on Mars news, why not subcribe to our RSS feed, we'll even throw in a free album.\n ","author":"emma","web_category":"science","title":"Mars Stinks ","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/PIA15283jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/sciencetech/mars-stinks/637"}
