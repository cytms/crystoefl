The commercial guidelines are available here, if you're interested.\nAside from going green, though, this building is really, really, really nice-- I would imagine as a function of being able to afford building up to LEED standards in New York-- they have a La Palestra heath club on site, offer a wine cellar, every condo has marble and oak floors with ten-foot ceilings... I mean, I have a ten-foot ceiling, too, but my carpet is probably the same age as I am.\nIn any event, I'm impressed, and also realize that this is probably the future of the environmental movement-- as much as it's people like you and I cutting back, it'll be moving up the market and expansion of \"greenwashing\" that will truly expand the capacity to create change.  Anyway, if you're in New York, and have $2.6 Million, it might be worth a look.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
