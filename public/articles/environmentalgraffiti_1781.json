Most recently he was asked to judge a design competition that would see a range of new bike racks designed specifically for New York City. A keen cyclist himself, Byrne was so taken by the idea that he submitted a few creations of his own.\nThe designs, made from the same square metal tubing used in ordinary bike racks, attempt to encapsulate and define various New York neighborhoods: a dollar sign sits on the walkway outside Wall Street; an electric guitar decorates the path in Williamsburg and in Brooklyn, a car near the entrance of the Lincoln Tunnel.\nDavid Byrne hopes that by integrating cycling with art cyclists will be seen as slightly cooler. He says, riding a bicycle \u201cused to be completely uncool\u2026 now it\u2019s cool in different ways: for some people it\u2019s cool if you have an old junker, for other people it\u2019s cool if you have a racing bike. Anyway, it doesn\u2019t immediately relegate you to nerd status anymore.\u201d\nVia: Treehugger\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
