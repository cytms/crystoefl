Yet the Second Battle of Bull Run, otherwise known as the Second Battle of Manassas, was significant in its own right. An unambiguous Southern victory, it cemented General Robert E. Lee\u2019s reputation as a brilliant tactician and paved the way for his first invasion of the North. It also helped to persuade distraught Union leaders in Washington, D.C., that emancipating the slaves had become a military necessity.\nAlthough the Confederates emerged victorious in July 1861 at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), when a coordinated counterattack sent Northern soldiers into a wild retreat, they withdrew the following March to a more defensible position 40 miles south. That same month, Union General George B. McClellan transported more than 100,000 men by boat to the tip of Virginia\u2019s York-James peninsular, from where he planned to march on Richmond. An overly cautious McClellan, who habitually overestimated the strength of his opponent, made it to within 6 miles of the Confederate capital. But from June 25 to July 1, 1862, his Army of the Potomac was repulsed by Lee in a series of actions that became known as the Seven Days\u2019 Battles.\nMeanwhile, on June 26, Union General John Pope was named commander of the newly formed Army of Virginia. He immediately issued a boastful address that would come back to haunt him. \u201cI come to you from the West, where we have always seen the backs of our enemies,\u201d Pope told his 50,000 troops. \u201cI desire you to dismiss from your minds certain phrases \u2026 [like] \u2018lines of retreat.\u2019\u201d Pope moved into Northern Virginia in an attempt to cut the railroad connecting Richmond with the Shenandoah Valley, but a relatively minor August 9 skirmish with Confederate General Thomas J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson\u2019s men stopped his advance.\nLee then decided to attack Pope before reinforcements from McClellan could arrive. On August 25 he divided his army in two, sending Jackson and 24,000 men on a march around Pope\u2019s right flank. After traveling an astounding 54 miles in less than two days, Jackson\u2019s troops reached a lightly defended Union supply base at Manassas Junction, where they proceeded to eat like pigs, load their packs with what they could carry and burn everything else. Much to Pope\u2019s chagrin, they also managed to disappear by the time Union forces reached the scene.\nThe Second Battle of Bull Run officially kicked off 150 years ago today, on August 28, when Jackson\u2019s troops fired upon an oblivious column of Union soldiers passing by Brawner Farm. Rather than run away, the northerners hurriedly returned fire, finally withdrawing past midnight. Early the next morning, Pope gathered his scattered force and ordered a number of piecemeal assaults against Jackson\u2019s position along an unfinished railroad. Despite being badly outnumbered, Jackson held on until the arrival of the rest of Lee\u2019s army a few hours later.\nThat night the Confederates readjusted their lines, prompting Pope to wrongly assume they were retreating. He sent a victory dispatch to Washington, D.C., and organized a pursuit. His soldiers only made it a few hundred yards, however, before being shot at by the dug-in rebel army. The northerners then struck at Jackson once again and drove him back. Some of Jackson\u2019s troops even ran out of ammunition and resorted to throwing stones. But on the other side of the battlefield, Confederate General James Longstreet brought up his artillery and savagely counterattacked. Though fierce fighting around Henry House Hill (a pivotal landmark in both Bull Runs) prevented Pope\u2019s men from being completely annihilated, they were forced to retreat back toward Washington in the rain. Including a rear-guard action on September 1, the Union suffered about 14,500 killed, captured or wounded at Second Bull Run, compared to about 9,500 casualties on the Confederate side.\nLee wasted no time in following up. On September 4 he began sending troops into Maryland, thereby prompting panicked Union leaders to organize bureaucrats into a militia and to order Treasury Department funds sent up to New York. Then, on September 17, the two sides both suffered enormous casualties during the Battle of Antietam, which sent the Confederates back into Southern territory. Five days later, President Abraham Lincoln issued a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and with the stroke of a pen changed the war aims of the Union.\nSecond Bull Run was thus immediately overshadowed by what came next, and it has remained that way ever since. In fact, no modern historian had thoroughly addressed the battle until John Hennessey came out with \u201cReturn to Bull Run: The Campaign and Battle of Second Manassas\u201d in 1992, according to Ray Brown, chief historian at Manassas National Battlefield Park. \u201cThe average visitor doesn\u2019t necessarily understand, first of all, that there was a Second Manassas battle to begin with, and they don\u2019t understand the importance the battle had in terms of the course of the war in 1862,\u201d Brown said. As part of Second Bull Run\u2019s 150th anniversary commemoration, park historians will lead walking tours over the entire battlefield, starting with Brawner Farm on August 28 and ending with Henry House Hill on August 30. Lectures, along with artillery, cavalry and infantry demonstrations, will then take place on September 1 and 2.","author":"Jesse  Greenspan","web_category":"news","title":"The Second Battle of Bull Run: A Civil War Sesquicentennial","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/second-bull-run-lithograph.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/the-second-battle-of-bull-run-a-civil-war-sesquicentennial"}
