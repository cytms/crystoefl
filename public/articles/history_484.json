Archaeological evidence suggests they traveled with portable wooden sundials, but these instruments would only have been useful on clear days. Along the Vikings\u2019 primary sailing routes, however, the sun could disappear for days at a time.\nThe sunstone\u2014or?s?larsteinn\u2014appears most prominently in a Viking saga about the Norse hero Sigurd. Under snowy, overcast skies, King Olaf asks Sigurd to locate the sun through the impenetrable haze. To verify Sigurd\u2019s answer, which turns out to be correct, Olaf \u201cgrabbed a sunstone, looked at the sky and saw from where the light came, from which he guessed the position of the invisible sun.\u201d\nIn 1967, the Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou speculated that these fabled stones were actually crystals\u2014possibly cordierite or Iceland spar\u2014that act as natural polarizing filters. By pointing a sunstone skyward and rotating it until the light passing through it reached its brightest point, he theorized, Viking navigators could have located the sun.\nMany scholars accept Ramskou\u2019s hypothesis that Vikings used polarizing crystals, but critics have doubted the technique\u2019s efficacy in cloudy or foggy weather. Recently, a group of researchers led by G?bor Horv?th of Hungary\u2019s E?tv?s University put it to the test, publishing their findings in the March 2011 issue of the online journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.\nThe team used a polarimeter, a device that measures the degree of polarization of light, under a range of weather conditions in Tunisia, Finland, Hungary and the Arctic Ocean. The study yielded unexpected results, suggesting that sunstone-like filters could indeed help pinpoint the sun\u2019s whereabouts through clouds and fog. \u201cTo our great surprise,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe patterns of the direction of polarization under totally overcast skies were very similar to those of the clear skies.\u201d\nIn the future, Horv?th and his colleagues hope to achieve a more realistic simulation of how Vikings may have used sunstones by collecting various types of naturally occurring polarizing crystals and enlisting volunteers to test them out. \u201cSince the psychophysical experiments\u2026cannot be performed with Viking navigators,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwe plan to measure the error functions by using male German, Hungarian and Swedish students.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Did Vikings Use Crystals to Navigate?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_171_16.png","url":"http://www.history.com/news/did-vikings-use-crystals-to-navigate"}
