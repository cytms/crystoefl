TK Maxx sold a DKNY coat with Arctic fox fur trimming, although the label only listed polyester and nylon.  The Edinburgh Woollen Mill sold a pair of gloves labelled as acrylic that included rabbit fur cuffs.\nIt\u2019s really quite poor timing by the retailers, as a plethora of anti-fur campaigns are under way. A recent RSPCA study found 93% of adults would be opposed to wearing real fur. The animal group plans to launch a campaign called 100% Fake to pressure retailers into performing more extensive checks on their products and improving the labelling on fur containing products. PETA is also currently running anti-fur ads featuring nude celebrities with the theme of \u201cI\u2019d rather be naked than wear fur.\u201d\nBoth the Edinburgh Woollen Mill and TK Maxx have admitted their mistake and changed the labeling on their products to include the real fur. TK Maxx director Deborah Dolce apologized profusely for the mistake, and thanked the RSPCA for bringing it to their attention. The company has a policy against selling real fur, but said the item slipped through the cracks as they purchase thousands of products from various outlets a year.\nThe Edinburgh Woollen Mill also apologized and will discontinue the sale of the gloves; although it correctly pointed out that the UK\u2019s labeling guidelines did not require it to list the rabbit fur in the gloves it sold. Marketing manager David Read said: \nThe RSPCA believes that real fur is being widely sold without being labeled in the UK. Lax labeling guidelines allow products to be sold without including their real fur content. As a result, many consumers who would not normally purchase real fur may unwittingly do so. There have also been reports of \u201cfake\u201d fur in America actually containing dog or cat fur. At least the environmentally conscious duped consumer can take solace in the Fur Council of Canada\u2019s recent claims that real fur is a \u201cgreen\u201d alternative to fake fur, which the group derides for containing nasty petrochemicals. \nIf you want to ensure you aren't duped into buying real fur, why not subcribe to our RSS feed, we'll even give you a free album. \n\n ","author":"Chris","web_category":"art+and+design","title":"UK \"Fake Fur\" Products Not So Fake","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/guido-daniele-illusion-02-ssjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/uk-fake-fur-products-not-so-fake/585"}
