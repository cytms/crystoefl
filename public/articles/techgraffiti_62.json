A celebrity criticizes the way that the rest of us impact the environment by living in 500 square foot apartments and driving a car that we wish somebody would steal, and then flies off to some exotic location in a private jet that dumps more carbon into the atmosphere in a day that I can in a year.\nAs it happens, that\u2019s not always going to be the case anymore. However, I imagine that celebrities will be criticizing us for our environmental habits for as long as there are celebrities. But maybe the next time they wing off in their self-righteousness it won\u2019t be so glaringly hypocritical, thanks to a trend blowing through that industry to pair the jet charter with carbon offsets.\nPhoto: Yeah, I\u2019d never seen one of these, either. Image from richardmasoner\nOf course, you all probably feel the same way we do about carbon offsets\u2013they\u2019re more than just a bit of a cop-out\u2013but in this case, it\u2019s something, at least. And something is better than running two jet engines for eight hours to move ONE person across the country, don\u2019t you think?\nPhoto: Image from cloudsoup\nWhat has happened is that the jet charter companies\u2013jets.com, Executive Charter Services, and a few more\u2013have gotten in on the greenwashing of the world. It\u2019s quite brilliant, actually\u2013it drives business to them and away from their competitors (if you use THEIR jets you hate the planet! Our jets are fueled by rainbows and butterflies), as well as gives them a veneer of \u201cgood corporate citizen.\u201d Oh, and it makes it possible for several thousand more dollars to sit overnight in their bank account before making the purchase, earning interest for the company. Because, you know, every little bit helps.\nOf course, the best solution to this problem is to not take private jets\u2013really not to travel at all\u2013but if you must fly, there\u2019s always Virgin America. They\u2019re using their profits to fund Virgin Fuel, which is dedicated to developing green aviation fuel.Environmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
