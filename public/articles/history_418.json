Their findings, published in the latest issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, are based on a newly discovered fossil of Boremys, part of a group of river turtles known as baenids that flourished in North America from roughly 80 million to 42 million years ago.\n\u201cThis was a turtle that had previously only been known from rocks about 70 million years old,\u201d said Tyler Lyson of Yale University, lead author of the paper and a member of the team that recovered the Boremys remains in southwestern North Dakota and eastern Montana. \u201cWith some additional fieldwork we found it in the Paleocene, the time right after the meteor impact.\u201d\nAlong with the baenids, other non-terrestrial turtles in various parts of the world are thought to have kept on crawling as most animals and plants dropped like flies. \u201cIn general, turtles do really well across the K-T boundary,\u201d Lyson said, referring to the point in the geologic record at which the mass extinction\u2014believed by many scientists to have been caused by a giant meteorite impact\u2014took place. Some turtle species took the calamity in such stride that, if their fossils alone are considered, it looks like the event never even happened.\nWhat made these slow-moving reptiles impervious to cataclysmic conditions that felled some of the largest creatures ever to roam the planet? \u201cTurtles are very robust animals,\u201d Lyson said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a long period of cold they can go into a period of estivation [inactivity], or they can go into hibernation. They can really slow down their metabolism and wait several years without food or water, whereas warm-blooded animals can only go a week or a couple of weeks without food.\u201d\nAquatic turtles\u2019 unfussy palates may also have helped to save them from the dinosaurs\u2019 fate. Even if the mollusks and crustaceans they typically preyed upon were affected, they could have subsisted on dead foliage and other debris scattered around by the meteor strike. \u201cA lot of them will just eat rotting plant material,\u201d Lyson said. Other characteristics that may have played a role in the turtles\u2019 survival include their small size, aquatic lifestyles and shells, which can store nutrients and act as a buffer against changing pH levels.\nSome turtles still living today, such as certain soft-shelled species in China, are descended from lineages that weathered the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction. The baenids, which disappeared between 35 and 40 million years ago, were not so lucky. Happiest in wet environments, they may have died out when a severe dry spell parched North America during the late Eocene, which corresponds to their decline, Lyson explained.\nAnother possibility is that the baenids ultimately lost out to their fellow survivors in the meteor impact\u2019s aftermath, Lyson said. With dinosaurs out of the picture, small mammals proliferated across the planet, evolving and adapting at extraordinary rates. \u201cThis turtle was unable to put its head into its shell,\u201d said Lyson. \u201cI could envision these early mammals eating turtles, especially the ones that did not have the mechanism to pull their heads in to protect themselves.\u201d\nEven today, 65 million years after their predecessors beat the odds, many turtle species could still go the way of the dinosaurs. \u201cIn a lot of areas, turtles are going extinct because they\u2019re being eaten by humans,\u201d Lyson said. \u201cThey were able to survive the biggest extinction event, but sadly their numbers are dwindling today as a result of humans.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Survivors in a Half Shell: Turtles Withstood Dinosaur Die-Out","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/turtle-survival-thumb.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/survivors-in-a-half-shell-turtles-withstood-dinosaur-die-out"}
