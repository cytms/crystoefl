The brightest comet of the 21st century likes to please its audience and rewards loyal viewers by being visible with the naked eye. Here\u2019s a collection of the best and most absolutely dazzling shots of the flashy comet.\nComet McNaught (C/2006 P1) was discovered by British-Australian astronomer Robert H. McNaught on August 7, 2006 during routine observations. Then, the comet was too dim to be seen with the naked eye but brightened rapidly and reached naked-eye visibility in early January of 2007.\n1.

The real spectacle was Comet McNaught, which remained bright and visible even throughout the firework display, here in the centre.\n2.

In the image below, the Milky Way and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds all put in an appearance, joined by McNaught of course. As if the night sky alone wasn\u2019t gorgeous enough, the picture was taken in front of the rugged mountains of Argentina\u2019s Patagonia region.\n6.

When the comet was at its point of closest approach to the Earth, called perihelion, on January 12, it became the brightest comet since Ikeya-Seki in 1965. It was therefore named the Great Comet of 2007.\nAfter passing the sun, McNaught was visible in the southern hemisphere and best viewed right after sunset; but viewers blocking the sun were even able to spot it in broad daylight.\n8.

There have been seven other instances of great comets that were visible with the naked eye and in broad daylight in the last 265 years \u2013 in 1976, 1965, 1927, 1910, 1882, 1843 and 1744.\nThe comet has long since faded out of naked-eye-view and would be visible only with a very large telescope near the constellation of Octans, leaving us to hope for another great comet soon.\nSources: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
