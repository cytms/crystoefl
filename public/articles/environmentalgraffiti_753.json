They\u2019re found spattered throughout the world, but astonishingly around 300 of the earth\u2019s estimated 700 mud volcanoes lie in Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea. Capable of ejecting millions of cubic metres of hydrocarbon gasses plus mountains of mud, these geological marvels \u2013 some of them over 200 metres high \u2013 are a sight to behold. \nHubble, bubble, toil and troublePhoto: Image: jrozwado\nMud volcanoes are concocted by geo-excreted gases and liquids in which solids are suspended. Excreted is the right word too, as 86% of the gas released by these flatulent natural wonders is methane, with the rest of the gases made up of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Just remember to pack your nose peg when you\u2019re planning your next trip to these sights in Eastern Azerbaijan.\nPyrotechnic mischief?Photo: Image: BuggeredCamera\nGurgling innocently away like a babe of the earth\u2019s crust, it\u2019s hard to believe Azerbaijan\u2019s mud volcanoes could be capable of mischief. Yet in 2001 a mud dome 15 km from the capital Baku behaved like a teenager up to pyrotechnic tomfoolery when it started spewing out flames 49 feet high. Some eyewitness reports even suggested the flames were initially many times higher.\nA natural spa...Photo: Image: magen inon \nBut despite the possible perils of mud volcanoes \u2013 whose mudflows have also been known to destroy homes \u2013 catastrophes and loss of life are thankfully rare. Indeed, such are the cool and ambient temperatures of Azerbaijan\u2019s seeps that geologists, locals and tourists make treks to take baths in the volcanoes' mud and feel its therapeutic effects.  \nStored beneath the surfacePhoto: Image: Rita Willaert\nAlthough mud volcanoes are also often associated with their much hotter lava volcano cousins, Azerbaijan\u2019s are visible signs of oil and gas reserves hidden far below the Caspian region. A deep mud reservoir connected to the surface acts as the source of eruptions here, and even in dormant periods seeping water at the surface shows traces of its subterranean origin.\nA true treasure trovePhoto: Image: Baku87\nThe mud volcanoes are situated in Azerbaijan\u2019s Gobustan State Reserve, a treasure trove of prehistoric rock carvings, the mud volcanoes themselves, and a natural musical stone called the Gaval Dash. Only to be found in Gobustan, this amazing large, flat stone, formed from three supports, produces tambourine-like sounds when struck. So what are you waiting for? Azerbaijan awaits.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, \nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
