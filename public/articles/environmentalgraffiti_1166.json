Some consider them tranquil havens where lost loves can be remembered and celebrated, yet to others they are eerie enclosures where the departed outnumber the living. For others still, a graveyard is where you bury your pudding.\nPhoto: Doofski\nThere is one graveyard in Vermont, North America that is rather unlike any other you\u2019ve encountered, because buried deep beneath the New English earth is a loved one of a different kind: ice cream. It has been said that despite the cold climate, the denizens of Vermont adore ice cream and that would certainly explain why touring Ben & Jerry\u2019s Waterbury factory has become the state\u2019s most popular tourist attraction.\nPhoto: Doofski\nThe factory offers a 30 minute guided tour, complete with the free samples of Ben & Jerry\u2019s famous product, the flavours of which vary from day-to-day. Indeed, the Ben & Jerry\u2019s brand is rather well-known for having a great variety of ice cream flavours to keep their consumers interested. But, as new products like Snickerdoodle Cookie, Dulce Delish or Boston Cream Pie appear on the market, so older flavours reach the end of their shelf lives. Where better to lay these now defunct flavours to rest than their very own cemetery?\nPhoto: Doofski\nUp a hill behind the factory is the Flavour Graveyard. Amid plastic tombstones and rhyming epitaphs wander sweet-toothed mourners, perhaps searching out the final resting place of a one-time favourite that didn\u2019t quite make it into the ice cream big time.\nPhoto: Doofski\nEach of the tombstones feature an artist\u2019s rendition of the deceased flavour, brief list of the primary ingredients and a winged cone, presumably captured mid-ascent to dessert heaven. It\u2019s easy to see how some of those currently six-feet under got there; \u2018Miz Jelena\u2019s Sweet Potato Pie\u2019 and \u2018Peanuts! Popcorn!\u2019 are among many that failed to capture the public\u2019s imagination. In fact Ben & Jerry\u2019s have eliminated a hefty 200 ice creams since their inception, and eight to twelve of the worst each year end up feeding the daisies at the Flavour Graveyard.\nPhoto: Doofski\nBut admission into the unusual graveyard is not necessarily for eternity, as the company\u2019s website explains:\n\u201cLet us know [if] you want us to bring back one of our dearly departed concoctions from the graveyard. If we ever feel the urge to exhume a product from the past, this is the place we look to see what is being asked for most.\u201d\nPhoto: Doofski\nIt\u2019s certainly one graveyard I wouldn\u2019t mind spending the night in.\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nPhoto: Doofski\nSpecial thanks to Doofski for permission to use his photographs.\nSources, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6","author":"Matt Forde","web_category":"travel","title":"The Graveyard Where Ice Cream Goes to Die","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/teaserjpg_5","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/beaten-track/news-graveyard-where-ice-cream-goes-die"}
