Three NEAq research expeditions since 2000 have found 120 species of coral and 520 species of fish, some new to science. It also has some of the most important sea bird nesting sites in the Pacific Ocean.\nPhoto: Randi Rotjan, New England AquariumTwo masked boobies (adult and chick) enjoying the view\nWe often hear of protected areas but don't really think of what it means. In the case of Kiribati, and most nations that set aside marine areas for conservation, they are restricting commercial fishing while allowing subsistence fishing (Kanton Island is the only inhabited island in the chain, with ~30 people) and sustainable development. As they are giving up the revenue that could be accrued if they did not give protected status, an endowment system has been set up by Conservation International and the New England Aquarium (NEAq) to both manage the area and compensate the people and government for any losses.\nPhoto: Jim StringerFish with neon green tails\nThe endowment system is one that needs to be used the world over to convince countries that they won't lose when they help preserve areas and species, and neither will the people of the area. Every step taken such as this by Kiribati and its conservation partners has long term good results for all of us.\nPhoto: Randi RotjanA single human footprint on uninhabited Enderbury Island\nRussell Mittermeier, President of Conservation International, says it best: \"The creation of this amazing marine protected area by a small island nation in the Pacific represents a commitment of historic proportions and all of this by a country that is under serious threat from sea-level rise attributed to global warming. The Republic of Kiribati has now set a standard for other countries in the Pacific and elsewhere in the world. We are proud to be associated with this effort that helps the people of Kiribati, and we call on governments and private conservation groups everywhere to support Kiribati in its efforts and make similar commitments to protect their own natural systems.\"\nSources: 1, 2","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"nature","title":"Phoenix Island: The Largest Marine Protected Area on Earth","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb28.webshots.com-43675-2686175750102347975S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-phoenix-island-protected-area-pipa-largest-marine-protected-area-world"}
