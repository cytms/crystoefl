Where the clouds of gas that characterize our galaxy's core are not visually obstructing the search, scientists can easily pick out the signature of a supernova with a telescope. When the clouds are there however, tools like the Chandra x-ray telescope and the Very Large Array radio telescope are used to search, and provide a much more complex set of data for the astronomers to sift through.\nSupernovas, which are rare in the Milky Way and therefore especially hard for scientists to study, rarely occur in the space of a human lifetime. We frequently don't discover them until several thousand years after the event. The potential windfall of observing one as it develops, something as simple as taking pictures of the development of the event over time hasn't been done before. This was previously unknown to scientists, and will provide a great deal of insight into the ways that our universe works.\n[National Geographic][AFP][AP]\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
