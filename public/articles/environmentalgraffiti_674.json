Set against a rugged mountain backdrop, this unique oasis in the Chihuahuan Desert is also exceptional due to the colonies of algae that inhabit its pools, associated as they are with the origins of life on our blue planet. \nGreen and serene: Close-up of the Poza AzulPhoto: Photo: patori hanzo\nCuatro Ci?negas comprises a network of more than 200 ponds, or pozas, connected by underground rivers and fed by springs whose waters percolate up through the desert floor. Of these, Poza Azul is one of the most stunning; a brilliant, sparkling blue body of water that is also home to a visitor\u2019s centre not to mention several super-rare, semi-aquatic turtles native only to this tiny part of the world. \nBrilliant blue: The Poza Hundidas CuatroPhoto: Photo: Void Memory\nUp to four metres deep and with visibility as good as 20 metres, the bathtub-warm water of the pozas is shot through with the occasional cooling current. Jets of tiny snail shells mixed with pebbles are sometimes created at the bottom by water entering from the underground water system, while whirlpools occasionally manifest themselves at the water\u2019s surface.\nMini maelstrom: A whirlpool forms in the Poza AzulPhoto: Photo: enriquevera2000\nCuatro Ci?negas means \u2018four marshes\u2019 in reference to the area's wetland topography, which lies amid the parched soil of North America\u2019s largest desert. The dozens of animal species unique to this fertile environment and its myriad lagoons include scorpions, snails, cichlid fish and poisonous frogs, while in and around the water various different endemic grasses, lilies and flowers flourish.\nCrystalline scene: The Poza Azul in a different lightPhoto: Photo: familia rodriguez pecero\nThe thriving biodiversity of this extraordinary if delicate ecosystem has earned it such nicknames as the \u2018Galapagos of Mexico\u2019 and the \u2018Desert Aquarium\u2019. Visitors are permitted to swim and snorkel in some of the pools, but suntan lotions, hair gels and any other wearable chemicals that might harm the many fish and micro-flora in the waters are strictly forbidden.\nPrehistoric life: Cyanobacteria in the pools of Cuatro Ci?negasPhoto: Photo: Tommy LaVergne/Rice University\nAs suggested, Cuatro Ci?negas harbours microscopic organisms of incredible importance to our understanding of life on earth. Live stromatolites are found here \u2013 geological phenomena formed by blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, now extinct in most of the world but linked to the beginnings of an oxygen-rich atmosphere more than 3 billion years ago.\nTurquoise tranquillity: The Poza Azul once morePhoto: Photo: Ignatius244\nYet this ecosystem \u2013 so similar to those that survived in prehistoric times \u2013 is under threat. Scientists researching in the area as well as some of the local residents have noticed early signs that this splendidly abundant basin could be on its way to drying out. Climate change and the introduction of major agriculture in adjacent valleys are possible culprits.\nDesert surrounds: Dunes in the protected Cuatro Ci?negas areaPhoto: Photo: Cazadordemolinos\nHaving said this, the waters of this preciously protected nature reserve remain serene and crystalline at least for the time being. We can only hope this remote desert biosphere will continue to astound people for many years to come \u2013 and that its steady stream of eco-tourists is not allowed to become a potentially damaging torrent. \nPhoto: Photo: Cazadordemolinos\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
