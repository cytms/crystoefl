An estimated 7,000 of those fought for the North and 3,000 fought for the South. Nonetheless, anti-Semitic attitudes persisted, even in the highest reaches of government. Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin was a particular target, with Senator (and future Vice President) Henry Wilson calling him of \u201cthat race that stoned prophets and crucified the redeemer of the world\u201d and Senator (and future President) Andrew Johnson attacking him as \u201ca sneaking, Jewish, unconscionable traitor.\u201d Around the same time, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman wrote about \u201cswarms\u201d of Jewish speculators, and a federal law briefly limited regimental chaplains to regularly ordained Christian ministers.\nAnti-Jewish bigotry was also widespread in the South. Congressman Henry S. Foote, for example, absurdly alleged that Jews controlled nine-tenths of the Confederacy\u2019s business interests and that by the end of the war southerners \u201cwould probably find nearly all the property of the Confederacy in the hands of Jewish shylocks.\u201d Yet the Confederacy never issued any edicts on par with General Orders No. 11, which came as part of a crackdown on black-market trading in such things as cotton, weapons and gold. The vast majority of these smugglers weren\u2019t Jewish \u2013 many were, in fact, army officers \u2013 but Jews began to face the brunt of the criticism.\nOne of these critics was General Ulysses S. Grant, who commanded the Union Army\u2019s Department of the Tennessee, a war zone located in parts of four states. In November 1862, Grant signed a couple of discriminatory orders, one of which banned Jews from traveling southward on the railroad. Then, on December 17, Grant issued General Orders No. 11, which stated that \u201cthe Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department and also department orders, are hereby expelled from the department within 24 hours. Any one returning \u2026 will be arrested and held in confinement.\u201d\nBy the end of the month, about 30 Jewish men and their families had been tossed out of Paducah, Kentucky. A baby was apparently almost left behind in the rush to make it to Cincinnati by riverboat. Jews were similarly expelled from Oxford, Jackson, Corinth and Holly Springs, Mississippi, including some forced to travel 40 miles to Memphis on foot. When a young couple in Holly Springs had their horse and buggy confiscated and were barred from changing out of wet clothes, the local authorities allegedly justified their actions by saying: \u201cBecause you are Jews, and are neither a benefit to the Union or Confederacy.\u201d\nCesar Kaskel, a Jewish merchant who was a resident of Paducah, Kentucky decided to fight back against these affronts. He not only alerted the press to General Orders No. 11, but also dispatched a telegram to the White House complaining that this \u201cinhuman order \u2026 would be the grossest violation of the Constitution and our rights\u201d and would place us \u201cas outlaws before the whole world.\u201d When that failed to provoke an official response, Kaskel traveled to Washington, D.C., and, with the help of an Ohio congressman, gained an audience with President Abraham Lincoln. Immediately thereafter, on January 4, 1863, Lincoln\u2019s general-in-chief of the Army revoked the order. In a follow-up meeting with Jewish leaders, Lincoln reportedly explained that \u201cto condemn a class is, to say the least, to wrong the good with the bad.\u201d\nDuring its two-and-a-half weeks on the books, General Orders No. 11 affected perhaps 100 Jews, a number that would have been much higher had Jewish soldiers in the Department of the Tennessee been banished along with civilians. Communication disruptions, caused by a Confederate attack on Holly Springs on December 20, 1862, also kept the number of expulsions to a minimum. Southern General Nathan Bedford Forrest, who later became first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, played an especially important though completely inadvertent role in helping the Jews by tearing up about 50 miles of railroad and telegraph lines, closing down transportation and communications lines.\nNorthern congressional Democrats failed in their subsequent attempt to censure Grant, a Republican, for what they described as his illegal and unjust regulation. In order to woo Jewish voters, Democrats thrust the issue back into the spotlight when Grant ran for president in 1868. Grant won that election comfortably, however, and never again made another anti-Jewish pronouncement. In fact, he appointed more Jews to public office than any of his predecessors, advocated on behalf of persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania and opposed an amendment to add the words \u201cChristian government\u201d to the Constitution. He also became the first president to attend a synagogue dedication, surprising the congregation by staying for three full hours.","author":"Jesse  Greenspan","web_category":"news","title":"General Grant Expels Jews From His War Zone, 150 Years Ago","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HITH-Ulysses-Grant.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/general-grant-expels-jews-from-his-war-zone-150-years-ago"}
