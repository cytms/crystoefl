Since its discovery, experts have endeavored to learn more about this mysterious human ancestor, described by some theorists as the elusive \u201cmissing link.\u201d Now, in a paper published online by the journal Nature today, researchers shed light on one of the ancient hominin\u2019s most defining characteristics: its diet. They report that, despite its advanced frontal lobe and sophisticated hand structure, Au. sediba munched on snacks that few modern humans could stomach.\nTo reconstruct Au. sediba\u2019s feeding patterns, an international team of scientists studied the teeth of two specimens from the Malapa site. First, they analyzed carbon isotopes contained in the enamel, which bear the traces of an individual\u2019s lifetime eating habits. Next, they examined microscopic signs of wear and tear, an indicator of food choices\u2019 texture and toughness. Finally, they recovered and evaluated tiny plant particles known as phytoliths from tartar on the teeth.\nThese findings are surprising because all other known human ancestors in Africa, including earlier australopithecines and the first Homo species, subsisted on much softer fare\u2014grasses and sedges from the savanna where they lived, along with the animals that ate these plants. But Au. sediba, too, lived in a grassland environment, so its apparent grub of choice was not only tough but also inconvenient. \u201cSavanna chimps have to travel very far each day to get enough food, much further than chimpanzees living in fully forested environments,\u201d said Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that Australopithecus sediba had to travel quite far each day to get enough food, but we don\u2019t have direct data for that yet.\u201d\nAccording to Henry, this research suggests that Au. sediba\u2014and perhaps other early human ancestors as well\u2014strayed further afield from their home turf than previously thought. \u201cI think our results are more evidence that hominins from about 2 million years ago were exploring a wider variety of environments and habitats than we knew previously,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be any number of reasons for this expansion, including climate shifts, competition among hominins or between hominins and other animals, or a whole variety or combination of other factors.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Human Ancestor Ate Leaves, Wood and Bark","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/a-sediba-skull.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/human-ancestor-ate-leaves-wood-and-bark"}
