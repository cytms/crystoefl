Less gruesomely known as crater corals or pacific rose corals, open brain corals are a favourite with aquarium owners but might also prove popular with slasher movie fanatics or proponents of bad brain surgery, if only they knew. Take a gander and see what you think.\nDefinitely something on the brain: Red Wellsophyllia open brain coralPhoto: \nPhoto: Reefland\nTough, colourful and captivating, open or folded brain corals are stony specimens characterised by two or three growths of expanding fleshy tissue known as polyps projecting from their base.

The rows of tentacles around their mouths measure as large as 10mm, and during the evening and night time these stinging tendrils come out to capture prey. These beauties of the ocean floor can also swell up to pull themselves out of their holes in the sand and even move around the sand bed. See? Not just a pretty face \u2013 and an ugly name. \nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
