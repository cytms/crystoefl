The subway cars are being placed on top of a old viaducts located on reclaimed land. The space will also include a 4,000 square-foot warehouse that will be used as a performance, art and cultural center.\nPhoto: \nImage: squirmelia\nThe seats have been pulled out to provide adequate workspace and the interiors are getting a complete makeover using sustainable materials. Energy will be provided by carbon neutral resources, such as solar power, and there will be an environmentally-friendly roof-top garden. Not only that but green-fingered artists who grow vegetables on site may even get a free lunch - not something you hear everyday in old London Town.\nFor more info on The Village Underground, check out their site.\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
