The difficulty lies in spotting them as these tiny, only mm-long creatures require a keen eye and a good macro lens. Luckily, quite a few photographers share our interest in snail babies and have captured the following awww-inspiring moments.\nTiny snail discovering the world:Photo: \nImage: Alison Jackson-Bass\nSnails have a ribbon-like tongue that has thousands of tooth-like structures, similar to a file. This tongue, called a radula, rasps away pieces of food. Photographer Alison Jackson-Bass, commenting on her encounter with baby snails captured in the sequence above, said: \u201cOne shot shows it nibbling away at the dry skin on my finger - I could actually feel it rasping away!\u201d Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re not thinking awwww\u2026\nCould it be any tinier?

As suggested, spotting and capturing them in macro with camera may be the most difficult part. Depending on the snail species, egg sizes range from 3 mm in diameter for the common grove snail to 6 mm in diameter for the Giant African Land Snail. Giant is relative in snail terms!\nGiant African Land Snail babies on a piece of cucumber:Photo: \nImage via petforums \nGarden snails (Helix aspersa) bury their eggs 5 to 10 cm deep in shallow topsoil, digging with their foot. The eggs will hatch after 2 to 4 weeks and the first task of a baby snail is to eat the egg from which it hatched. As baby snails\u2019 shells are still very weak, they need this immediate calcium boost to survive.\nA just hatched snail baby, only 2-3 mm long!Photo: \nImage: Marianne\nHere a view from below \u2013 hello!Photo: \nImage: Marianne \nThe tiny young snails are almost completely transparent and colourless. Once they\u2019ve made their way above ground, they will continue their quest for food, mainly going for the leaves and vegetables they find around them.\nHere\u2019s proof \u2013 not even 1 cm long!Photo: \nImage: Patty O\u2019Hearn Kickham\nBaby snail on its hind, er, foot to catch a drop of dew from a spider\u2019s web:Photo: \nImage: Ingrid Taylar\nAbout three months after hatching, the baby snails will look like a miniature version of their parents. They will reach adult size after 2 to 3 years and will be sexually mature, depending on the snail species, between 6 weeks and 5 years!\nWhen all the world\u2019s a tomato:Photo: \nImage: zenera\nAfter a few weeks, they show a slight colouration, usually bluish, before they take on their adult colour.\nBaby snail on a coin, found in Flatbush, Brooklyn:Photo: \nImage: Frank H.
