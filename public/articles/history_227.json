Made by Parker Brothers, the weapon is thought to have accompanied the sharpshooting celebrity when she traveled to England with Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s famed Wild West show in 1887. During that tour, Oakley performed for European royalty attending the queen\u2019s Golden Jubilee.\nAccording to Heritage Auctions, which handled the sale for Oakley\u2019s descendants, Oakley became disenchanted with the Parker Brothers shotgun midway through her overseas stay, later presenting it as a gift to her husband\u2019s brother.\nBorn Phoebe Ann Moses in an Ohio cabin in 1860, Oakley demonstrated an extraordinary gift for marksmanship at an early age. At 15 she won a shooting match against a traveling exhibition sharpshooter named Frank Butler, whom she soon married. The pair began performing together and eventually joined Buffalo Bill\u2019s touring company. Oakley continued to set records well into her 60s; she also campaigned for women\u2019s rights to work, participate in sports and bear arms. She died in 1926 at age 66.\nRoughly 100 items that once belonged to Oakley, including the Parker Brothers shotgun, were sold in Dallas, Texas, by Heritage Auctions on Sunday. Featuring rifles, letters and photographs, among other things, the collection was put up for sale by the famous sharpshooter\u2019s great-grandnieces. They had inherited the artifacts from their mother, Billie Butler Serene, whose grandfather was Frank Butler\u2019s brother.\n\u201cWe had decades worth of treasures in steamer trunks,\u201d said Terrye Holcomb, one of the descendants. \u201cMy mother cherished her family, and when the family passed, this is what she clung to.\u201d\nAlong with the Parker Brothers gun, other big-ticket items included a Marlin .22 caliber rifle that went for $83,650 and Oakley\u2019s iconic Stetson hat, which brought in $17,925. The entire collection sold for $518,875.\n\u201cThe intense interest and great prices this auction brought show the ongoing fascination people have with Annie Oakley and highlight the value of 125 years of careful stewardship by her loved ones,\u201d said Tom Slater, director of historical auctions for Heritage Auctions.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Annie Oakley\u2019s Gun Sells at Auction","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/annie-oakley-gun.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/annie-oakleys-gun-sells-at-auction"}
