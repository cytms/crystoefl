The island is divided into three stations: Station 3, located at the southern part of the island where the cheaper lodgings can be found; Station 2, roughly in the center and meant for those who want to be close to bars and nightlife; and Station 1, the area for isolated accommodations. The latter offers peace and quiet away from the usual action-packed Boracay night scene. \nPhoto: Jason N. Lunas\nLeisure activities are available in Boracay and these include scuba diving, kiteboarding, snorkeling, windsurfing and beach relaxation. It is also the site of a world-class, 18-hole par 72 golf course designed by Graham Marsh.\nThe weather in Boracay has two weather patterns known locally as Amihan and Habagat.
