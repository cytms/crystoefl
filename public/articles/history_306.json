As the story went, Mrs. Lincoln commissioned the portrait in secret as a present for her husband, but didn\u2019t have the chance to give it to him before he was assassinated at Ford\u2019s Theatre on April 14, 1865. \nThe problem with this touching back story? It\u2019s all false, according to the Lincoln library and museum and the independent art conservator recently hired to clean the painting. The painting dates to the 19th century, it\u2019s true, but was painted by an anonymous artist (not Carpenter) of an unknown female subject (not Mrs. Lincoln). Conservator Barry Bauman blames the hoax on Ludwig Pflum, a colorful, self-made character who renamed himself Lew Bloom and turned to art collecting after careers as a jockey, circus clown, boxer and vaudeville performer. Bloom, who dabbled in oil painting, probably altered the facial features of the painting\u2019s original subject and painted over a necklace with a cross, then added the Lincoln miniature. \nWhen the New York Times announced the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the painting in 1929, it repeated Bloom\u2019s fabricated story that Mrs. Lincoln (distraught with grief and strapped for cash) asked Carpenter to dispose of the portrait after the president\u2019s assassination. The artist then supposedly sold it to the wealthy Neafie family of Philadelphia, who gave it to Bloom\u2019s sister Susan, a singer, in thanks for her nursing an ill Neafie relative. In fact, Susan Bloom was only 5 years old at the time the relative died\u2014but this did not stop the hoax from succeeding. The \u201crarely seen painting\u201d was reproduced in other national publications and later used to illustrate at least two biographies of the first lady. \nAnd historians weren\u2019t the only ones fooled\u2014the Lincoln family bought the story as well. The daughter of the Lincolns\u2019 eldest son, Robert (who had died in 1926), bought the painting, and it remained in the family\u2019s possession until 1976, when they donated it to the Illinois state historical library. Interestingly, conservators at the Art Institute of Chicago realized the painting had been retouched at that time, and even uncovered the cross, but didn\u2019t seem to suspect fraud. With the recent discovery, the painting (which had been insured for $400,000) lost most of its value. It was moved out of the governor\u2019s mansion, though it may still be hung in the Lincoln library.    \nBloom (who died shortly after releasing the painting) isn\u2019t the only con artist to have pulled off a high-profile art hoax. Perhaps the most celebrated art forger of the 20th century was Han van Meegeren, a Dutch painter who made more than $3 million (the equivalent of some $30 million today) by passing off his own works as those of the 17th century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. As recounted by Edward Dolnick in his book \u201cThe Forger\u2019s Spell\u201d (2008), van Meegeren\u2019s most famous mark was Hermann Goering, the second-most-powerful man in Nazi Germany and a fanatic art collector. In 1945, the Allies took possession of Goering\u2019s enormous art collection, which he had amassed largely through looting and confiscation of property all over Nazi-occupied Europe. The paper trail brought them to van Meegeren, who admitted to faking the Vermeer. Tried, convicted and sentenced to one year in prison in 1947 (he died of a heart attack a year later without serving any time), van Meegeren was honored as a hero for conning the hated Nazi leader.
