{"summary":"Genetically speaking, Sweden\u2019s Neolithic farmers resembled today\u2019s southern Europeans, while their hunter-gatherer neighbors looked like modern Finns. That\u2019s because today\u2019s Swedes descended from both lineages, which combined over time through interbreeding, Skoglund said.","advice_category":"1","content":"\nA new study by a Swedish and Danish team supports a tie between migration and agriculture, suggesting that farming\u2019s early foot soldiers marched into Europe and eventually migrated northward. Led by computational geneticist Pontus Skoglund of Uppsala University, the researchers analyzed large amounts of DNA from four individuals excavated from 5,000-year-old burial grounds in Sweden.\nThree of the skeletons\u2014a 7-year-old child, 45-year-old woman and 25-year-old man\u2014were interred among beads and pottery in collective graves associated with the Pitted Ware culture, a hunter-gatherer group that once thrived in southern Scandinavia. The fourth\u2014a 20-year-old woman found under stone slabs in a megalithic tomb\u2014belonged to an agricultural society known as the Funnelbeaker culture.\nAlthough these Stone Age humans lived at roughly the same time and less than 250 miles apart, striking differences emerged between the hunter-gatherers\u2019 genomes and that of the lone farmer. \u201cWe found that the farmer was most similar to Mediterranean populations such as Sardinians and Cypriots, whereas the hunter-gatherers were most similar to Northern Europeans,\u201d said Skoglund.\nThe researchers\u2019 findings implied that agriculture\u2019s early adapters in Scandinavia hailed from the south, meaning that farming had traveled with groups of people rather than simply through the grapevine. \u201cTo find a farmer individual in Scandinavia who looks like a modern-day southern European is really some of the most direct evidence that one could hope to obtain,\u201d Skoglund said.\nGenetically speaking, Sweden\u2019s Neolithic farmers resembled today\u2019s southern Europeans, while their hunter-gatherer neighbors looked like modern Finns. Neither group was similar to Sweden\u2019s current population, however. That\u2019s because today\u2019s Swedes descended from both lineages, which combined over time through interbreeding, Skoglund said.\n\u201cContact between hunter-gatherer and farming populations was initially low as farmers spread from the south, but they later started mixing more and more,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat happened when they met is mainly a question for archaeology, and we hope that our study can provide some perspectives and hypotheses for archaeologists to work with.\u201d\nThe researchers\u2019 study appears in the April 27 issue of the journal Science.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Migrants Brought Farming to Europe, Ancient DNA Suggests","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/agriculture-migration.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/migrants-brought-farming-to-europe-ancient-dna-suggests"}
