It also typically includes such dangerous substances as sulfuric acid. When it's not melting your face, it can cause severe breathing problems especially among those who suffer from asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.\nThe dangerous gas has so far forced 6 people into Red Cross shelters, and another 42 into hotels; the park officials are persisting in their hope that the trade winds will resume on Thursday and clear the islands, but are cautioning against any such hope in the citizenry, because, well, that's what officials do in times of natural crisis.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
