Shakespeare\u2019s father held a lot of different jobs, and at one point got paid to drink beer.\nThe son of a tenant farmer, John Shakespeare was nothing if not upwardly mobile. He arrived in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1551 and began dabbling in various trades, selling leather goods, wool, malt and corn. In 1556 he was appointed the borough\u2019s official \u201cale taster,\u201d meaning he was responsible for inspecting bread and malt liquors. The next year he took another big step up the social ladder by marrying Mary Arden, the daughter of an aristocratic farmer who happened to be his father\u2019s former boss. John later became a moneylender and held a series of municipal positions, serving for some time as the mayor of Stratford. In the 1570s he fell into debt and ran into legal problems for reasons that remain unclear.\n2. Shakespeare married an older woman who was three months pregnant at the time.\nIn November 1582, 18-year-old William wed Anne Hathaway, a farmer\u2019s daughter eight years his senior. Instead of the customary three times, the couple\u2019s intention to marry was only announced at church once\u2014evidence that the union was hastily arranged because of Anne\u2019s eyebrow-raising condition. Six months after the wedding, the Shakespeares welcomed a daughter, Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith followed in February 1585. Little is known about the relationship between William and Anne, besides that they often lived apart and he only bequeathed her his \u201csecond-best bed\u201d in his will.\n3. Shakespeare\u2019s parents were probably illiterate, and his children almost certainly were.\nNobody knows for sure, but it\u2019s quite likely that John and Mary Shakespeare never learned to read or write, as was often the case for people of their standing during the Elizabethan era. Some have argued that John\u2019s civic duties would have required basic literacy, but in any event he always signed his name with a mark. William, on the other hand, attended Stratford\u2019s local grammar school, where he mastered reading, writing and Latin. His wife and their two children who lived to adulthood, Susanna and Judith, are thought to have been illiterate, though Susanna could scrawl her signature.\n4. Nobody knows what Shakespeare did between 1585 and 1592.\nTo the dismay of his biographers, Shakespeare disappears from the historical record between 1585, when his twins\u2019 baptism was recorded, and 1592, when the playwright Robert Greene denounced him in a pamphlet as an \u201cupstart crow.\u201d The insult suggests he\u2019d already made a name for himself on the London stage by then. What did the newly married father and future literary icon do during those seven \u201clost\u201d years? Historians have speculated that he worked as a schoolteacher, studied law, traveled across continental Europe or joined an acting troupe that was passing through Stratford. According to one 17th-century account, he fled his hometown after poaching deer from a local politician\u2019s estate.\n5. Shakespeare\u2019s plays feature the first written instances of hundreds of familiar terms.\nWilliam Shakespeare is believed to have influenced the English language more than any other writer in history, coining\u2014or, at the very least, popularizing\u2014terms and phrases that still regularly crop up in everyday conversation. Examples include the words \u201cfashionable\u201d (\u201cTroilus and Cressida\u201d), \u201csanctimonious\u201d (\u201cMeasure for Measure\u201d), \u201ceyeball\u201d (\u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d) and \u201clackluster\u201d (\u201cAs You Like It\u201d); and the expressions \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d (\u201cOthello\u201d), \u201cin a pickle\u201d (\u201cThe Tempest\u201d), \u201cwild goose chase\u201d (\u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d) and \u201cone fell swoop\u201d (\u201cMacbeth\u201d). He is also credited with inventing the given names Olivia, Miranda, Jessica and Cordelia, which have become common over the years (as well as others, such as Nerissa and Titania, which have not).\n6. We probably don\u2019t spell Shakespeare\u2019s name correctly\u2014but, then again, neither did he.\nSources from William Shakespeare\u2019s lifetime spell his last name in more than 80 different ways, ranging from \u201cShappere\u201d to \u201cShaxberd.\u201d In the handful of signatures that have survived, the Bard never spelled his own name \u201cWilliam Shakespeare,\u201d using variations or abbreviations such as \u201cWillm Shakp,\u201d \u201cWillm Shakspere\u201d and \u201cWilliam Shakspeare\u201d instead. However it\u2019s spelled, Shakespeare is thought to derive from the Old English words \u201cschakken\u201d (\u201cto brandish\u201d) and \u201cspeer\u201d (\u201cspear\u201d), and probably referred to a confrontational or argumentative person.\n7. Shakespeare\u2019s epitaph wards off would-be grave robbers with a curse.\nWilliam Shakespeare died on April 23, 1616, at the age of 52\u2014not bad for an era when the average life expectancy ranged between 30 and 40 years. We may never know what killed him, although an acquaintance wrote that the Bard fell ill after a night of heavy drinking with fellow playwright Ben Jonson. Despite his swift demise, Shakespeare supposedly had the wherewithal to pen the epitaph over his tomb, which is located inside a Stratford church. Intended to thwart the numerous grave robbers who plundered England\u2019s cemeteries at the time, the verse reads: \u201cGood friend, for Jesus\u2019 sake forbeare, / To dig the dust enclosed here. Blessed be the man that spares these stones, / And cursed be he that moves my bones.\u201d It must have done the trick, since Shakespeare\u2019s remains have yet to be disturbed.\n8. Shakespeare wore a gold hoop earring\u2014or so we think.\nOur notion of William Shakespeare\u2019s appearance comes from several 17th-century portraits that may or may not have been painted while the Bard himself sat behind the canvas. In one of the most famous depictions, known as the Chandos portrait after its onetime owner, the subject has a full beard, a receding hairline, loosened shirt-ties and a shiny gold hoop dangling from his left ear. Even back in Shakespeare\u2019s time, earrings on men were trendy hallmarks of a bohemian lifestyle, as evidenced by images of other Elizabethan artists. The fashion may have been inspired by sailors, who sported a single gold earring to cover funeral costs in case they died at sea.\n9. North America\u2019s 200 million starlings have Shakespeare to thank for their existence.\nWilliam Shakespeare\u2019s works contain more than 600 references to various types of birds, from swans and doves to sparrows and turkeys. The starling\u2014a lustrous songbird with a gift for mimicry, native to Europe and western Asia\u2014makes just one appearance, in \u201cHenry IV, Part 1.\u201d In 1890 an American \u201cbardolator\u201d named Eugene Schiffelin decided to import every kind of bird mentioned in Shakespeare\u2019s oeuvre but absent from the United States. As part of this project, he released two flocks of 60 starlings in New York\u2019s Central Park. One hundred twenty years later, the highly adaptable species has taken over the skies, becoming invasive and driving some native birds to the brink of extinction.\n10. Some people think Shakespeare was a fraud.\nHow did a provincial commoner who had never gone to college or ventured outside Stratford become one of the most prolific, worldly and eloquent writers in history? Even early in his career, Shakespeare was spinning tales that displayed in-depth knowledge of international affairs, European capitals and history, as well as familiarity with the royal court and high society. For this reason, some theorists have suggested that one or several authors wishing to conceal their true identity used the person of William Shakespeare as a front. Proposed candidates include Edward De Vere, Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and Mary Sidney Herbert. Most scholars and literary historians remain skeptical about this hypothesis, although many suspect Shakespeare sometimes collaborated with other playwrights.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"10 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About William Shakespeare","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/shakespeare-portrait.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-william-shakespeare"}
