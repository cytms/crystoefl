What is unfortunate however, is that the study led by Professor Les Baillie and Doctor Theresa Gallagher, concluded that the cure only works if the tea is black and doesn\u2019t work at all with whole milk. That means I\u2019m probably screwed in a terrorist attack.\nPublished in the March issue of the Society for Applied Microbiology's journal Microbiologist, Professor Baillie said:\n\n\nProfessor Baillie continued: \u201cI would suggest that in the event that we are faced with a potential bio-terror attack, individuals may want to forgo their dash of milk at least until the situation is under control.\nThis research is definitely an interesting solution. Could it be the next line of defense against bio-terrorism? We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.
