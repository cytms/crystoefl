Other studies have also looked at emergency room trips for allergic reactions, or evaluated doctors' diagnoses in medical records.\n?\nGupta and her colleagues instead wanted to design a study focused solely on the rate and severity of food allergies. They surveyed a nationally representative sample of almost 40,000 U.S. adults who lived with a child under 18.\n?\nThose adults filled out an online questionnaire about allergies based on a single kid in their household, reporting whether or not the child had any signs and symptoms of a food allergy, had ever been diagnosed with an allergy by a doctor, and had ever had a severe allergic reaction to food.\n?\nThe results, published today in Pediatrics, showed that 8 percent of kids had a diagnosed food allergy or convincing symptoms that indicated an allergy - almost 6 million U.S. kids, the researchers said. Kids were most commonly allergic to peanuts, milk, and shellfish.\n?\nWhat was interesting was not just how many kids had allergies, Gupta said, but how many of those allergies were severe - cutting off a kid's airway or causing blood pressure to drop.\n?\n\"One of our big findings was that 2 in 5 kids who had allergies had a severe reaction or a life-threatening reaction,\" Gupta said.\n?\n\"There are a lot of misconceptions of what allergies are,\" she added. \"When you think of allergies, you don't think of life-threatening.\"\n?\nSevere reactions were more common in older kids, possibly because young kids with allergies are more likely to be monitored by parents to make sure they stay away from potential allergy triggers, Gupta explained.\n?\nShe and her colleagues also found that black and Asian kids had higher chances of having a food allergy than white kids?\u2014?but that they were less likely to have that allergy diagnosed by a doctor.\n?\nThat disparity \"needs to be addressed,\" Dr. Scott Sicherer, an allergy researcher at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, told Reuters Health.\n?\n\"The family is saying that their child had convincing reactions and yet they weren't really evaluated to confirm that with a doctor,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study.\n?\n\"Is that because they're not getting the health care they need? Is that because there's not an appropriate amount of concern? I would be worried that the next reaction could be severe and they're not prepared for it.\"\n?\nWhile the findings can't show whether or not food allergies are on the rise, Gupta thinks that's the case.\n?\n\"As a clinician, I see it a lot more,\" Gupta said. Sicherer agreed that he thinks food allergies are becoming more frequent, but said that researchers aren't sure why that is.\n?\nThe next question, Gupta said, is whether there is something going on in the environment that is driving that increase.\n?\nOn the Web: Pediatrics, online June 20, 2011.\n?\nCopyright 2011??Reuters US Online Report Health News","author":"Genevra Pittman, Reuters","web_category":"health#allergies","title":"Food allergies affect 1 in 12 kids","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/KidsAllergies_main_0620.jpg","url":"http://www.mnn.com//health/allergies/stories/food-allergies-affect-1-in-12-kids"}
