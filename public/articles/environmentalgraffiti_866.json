Nonetheless, an exterminator was called in to remove the bees and the family evacuated.\nAs bees continue disappearing around the United States, these roving swarms are becoming more common: colony life breaks down, and then the survivors set out en masse.\nKrivsky's bees were most likely reconnoitering for a larger population that was attempting to establish a new hive, a number that could have reached up to 80,000. Why the house? Development could have played a role-- as fewer and fewer trees are available for shelter in urban areas, bees, which seek the same sorts of criteria as humans in a permanent home, are apparently inclined to try to become our roommates.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
