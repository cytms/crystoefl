Wynne was supposedly an exporter, but in reality he was a spy who scored one of the largest coups in Cold War espionage. For years Greville received secrets from Soviet Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, an intelligence officer who revealed information about Russian ballistic missile programs to the West. The colonel\u2019s disclosures proved vital during the height of the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962 and may have helped avoid nuclear war. Shortly thereafter, both Wynne and Penkovsky were arrested for their clandestine activities. Penkovsky was sentenced to death but is believed to have taken his own life in May 1963 in a Soviet prison, while Wynne served 18 months before crossing the Havel on the Glienicke Br?cke.\nJune 12, 1985: Marian Zacharski and 25 American agents\nA Polish-born spy, Marian Zacharski adopted the guise of a legitimate businessman in the United States in the late 1970s. The reportedly handsome and resourceful agent befriended William Holden Bell, an engineer at Hughes Aircraft. Over the course of three years, Zacharski persuaded Bell to pass along plans for secret radar systems and some of the technology behind early stealth aircraft. Zacharski\u2019s tactics in recruiting Bell were so impressive that they are still studied by the FBI decades later.\nIn 1981 a U.S. federal judge sentenced Zacharski to life in prison. Four years later he wound up across the Havel from 25 American agents ready to be traded for him. Along with three other Eastern Bloc spies, Zacharski traversed the Bridge of Spies into Potsdam and East Germany, eventually making his way back to his native country. After the fall of the communism in Poland, Zacharski found success in the private sector before unsuccessfully attempting to return to espionage.  In 1994 he was tapped to head Poland\u2019s intelligence service, but was later removed due to international criticism of the pick.\nAs officials kept media at a distance from the Glienicke, Shcharansky traveled across the snow-covered bridge in a Mercedes. The U.S. ambassador to West Germany greeted him as he approached West Berlin, saying, \u201cPresident Reagan and others worked and prayed for many years for this.\u201d Shcharansky was whisked away in a waiting Israeli jet and enjoyed a hero\u2019s welcome in his newly adopted country. In exchange, the United States released Karl and Hana Koecher of Czechoslovakia. Karl had worked for the CIA before pleading guilty to espionage charges in 1984; his wife was being held as a material witness.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"Prisoner Exchanges Across the Bridge of Spies, From Powers to Shcharansky","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/glienicke-bridge.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/prisoner-exchanges-across-the-bridge-of-spies-from-powers-to-shcharansky"}
