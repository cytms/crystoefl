She doesn\u2019t have a passport.\nDespite being history\u2019s most widely traveled head of state\u2014she has reportedly visited 116 countries during her 60-year reign\u2014Elizabeth does not hold a passport. Since all British passports are issued in the queen\u2019s name, she herself doesn\u2019t need one. She also doesn\u2019t require a driver\u2019s license, though she has been known to take joyrides around her various estates in her Range Rover.\n2. She has two different birthdays.\nThe reigning British monarch was born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary of York on April 21, 1926. However, each Commonwealth country traditionally celebrates her birthday on a designated day in May or June. In the United Kingdom, for instance, it falls on the first, second or third Saturday in June. Britain has officially marked its sovereign\u2019s birthday since 1748, when the event was merged with the annual \u201cTrooping the Colour\u201d ceremony and parade. Elizabeth spends her real birthday enjoying private festivities with her family.\n3. She drove a truck during World War II. \nAfter months of begging her father to let his heir pitch in, Elizabeth\u2014then an 18-year-old princess\u2014joined the Women\u2019s Auxiliary Territorial Service during World War II. Known as Second Subaltern Elizabeth Windsor, she donned a pair of coveralls and trained in London as a mechanic and military truck driver. The queen remains the only female member of the royal family to have entered the armed forces and is the only living head of state who served in World War II.\n4. She paid for her wedding dress with ration coupons.\nPrincess Elizabeth married her third cousin Philip Mountbatten, formerly prince of Greece and Denmark, on November 20, 1947. Held during the postwar recovery years, their wedding was a relatively understated affair, at least compared to the lavish union of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in July 1981. With austerity measures still in effect, Elizabeth had to save up ration coupons to purchase the material for her wedding dress, an ivory satin gown designed by Norman Hartnell and encrusted with 10,000 white pearls.\n5. She didn\u2019t take her husband\u2019s name.\nElizabeth\u2019s father, George VI, was born into the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, but during World War I the family name was changed to Windsor amid anti-German sentiment. Similarly, her husband Prince Philip dropped his father\u2019s Germanic surname, Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl?cksburg, and adopted that of his maternal grandparents, Mountbatten, during their engagement. But when Elizabeth ascended the throne, her mother and Prime Minister Winston Churchill did everything in their power to prevent the queen and her line from becoming the House of Mountbatten. They succeeded, but several years later Elizabeth proclaimed that some of her descendants would carry the name Mountbatten-Windsor\u2014probably in an attempt to placate her fuming husband.\n6. She sent an email in 1976.\nOn March 26, 1976, Queen Elizabeth sent her first email while taking part in a network technology demonstration at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, a research facility in Malvern, England. The message was transmitted over ARPANET, the forerunner of the modern Internet. She is considered the first head of state to have used electronic mail.\n7. She was shot at by a teenager.\nDuring her birthday celebration on June 13, 1981, shots rang out as Elizabeth rode her horse in a parade near Buckingham Palace. Marcus Sarjeant, a 17-year-old who idolized the assassins of John F. Kennedy and John Lennon, had fired six blank shots in the queen\u2019s direction. Swiftly subdued by police, the teen would spend three years in a psychiatric prison. Elizabeth, meanwhile, merely calmed her startled horse and resumed her procession.\n8. She once woke up to find a stalker in her bedroom.\nOn July 9, 1982, a 31-year-old psychiatric patient named Michael Fagan scaled a Buckingham Palace drainpipe and sauntered into Elizabeth\u2019s chambers. The sleeping monarch awoke to find a strange man perched on the edge of her bed, dripping blood from where he had cut his hand while wandering the palace\u2019s dark corridors. Initially unable to reach the police, Elizabeth engaged Fagan in conversation for at least 10 minutes, listening to him chat about his personal problems and relationship with his four children. Finally, a footman roused from his slumber seized the loquacious intruder. It turned out that Fagan, who was ordered to spend six months in a mental hospital, had also crept into the royal residence weeks earlier, making off with a bottle of Prince Charles\u2019 white wine.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"8 Things You May Not Know About Queen Elizabeth II","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/qeii-travel.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-queen-elizabeth-ii"}
