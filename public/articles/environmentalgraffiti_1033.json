In fact, we've never had one before. The keepers were out on the reserve one day and heard these cries. When they found him at first they hoped his mother would come back.\nMax, 19 months old, is fed 30 pints a day of Lactogen milk, an extremely expensive formula which is paid for by the British Airways community program.  He is being cared for by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Kenya, famous for their role in BBC\u2019s The Elephant Diaries.\nThe Trust plans to help Max live a full life by building him a special pen. The one square mile area will be fenced in to allow him to run around and play safely.\nBlack rhinos are a highly endangered species, with an estimated wild population of around 2,700. They\u2019ve lost 96% of their population since 1970, mostly due to poaching.\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Abandoned Blind Baby Rhino On 24-Hour Watch","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/cuteyjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/abandoned-blind-baby-rhino-on-24-hour-watch/425"}
