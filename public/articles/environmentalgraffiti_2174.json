Image by Ekem.\nBut according to some scientists, humans have affected the world so much that we actually need to change the name of the current geological era to reflect our impact.\nWe\u2019re currently living in what is called the Holocene. The period started with the end of the last major ice age in 9600 B.C. It\u2019s name translates to \u201centirely recent\u201d in Greek. Several geologists at the University of Leicester and the Geological Society of London, however, want to change the name of this epoch to the Anthropocene (anthro for human) to reflect the effect of humans on the landscape.\nThe scientists have lobbied the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the international body in charge of naming geological epochs. They argue that humans have physically altered planet Earth and its ecology so markedly that a difference between pre- and post-industrial periods must be drawn.\nThey base their argument on what they describe as four major phenomena that differentiate the past and present. These phenomena are: a change in the worldwide patterns of sediment erosion and deposition, significant changes to the world\u2019s carbon cycle and global temperatures, ocean acidification, and large scale changes to the planet\u2019s animals and plants.\nJan Zalasiewicz, leader of the lobbying group and a geologist at University of Leicester, said: \"Sufficient evidence has emerged of stratigraphically significant change for recognition of the Anthropocene - currently a vivid yet informal metaphor of global environmental change - as a new geological epoch.\"\nThe name Anthropocene was coined by Nobel Prize winning chemist Paul Crutzen. He made an offhand remark in 2002 suggesting the name for the \u201cnew era\u201d of growing human development and population.\nSource: Telegraph\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on humans' effects on the environment and ecology, why not subcribe to our RSS feed?
