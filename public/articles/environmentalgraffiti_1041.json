Indonesia attempted to rally the other rainforest containing nations, such as Brazil, Mexico, Costa Rica and several others.\nIndonesia has been at the forefront of action on climate change among developing nations. Rachmat Witoelar, environmental minister of Indonesia, had recently proposed that richer nations pay Indonesia $20 per hectare to preserve the rapidly shrinking forests in the country.\nIndonesia\u2019s request has resulted in some criticism, particularly over their own environmental record. The country is one of the top 3 nations in greenhouse gas emissions, mostly due to massive deforestation. Some see the government\u2019s request for money as a type of environmental hostage taking, and many feel that Indonesia\u2019s request smacks of hypocrisy in light of its own poor environmental record.\nSource: Telegraph\n\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Indonesia Demands Cash To Save Forests","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb12.webshots.com-44235-2871561740105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/indonesia-demands-cash-to-save-forests/397"}
