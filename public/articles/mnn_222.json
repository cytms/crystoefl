But then, as I was watching the CNN recap this morning, I heard what made me realize that this was a historic election (besides re-election of an African-American president and ballot approval for gay marriage in several states) in yet another way: Women will now govern the state of New Hampshire.?\n\n\t?\n\n\tKnown for its motto, \"Live Free or Die\" emblazoned proudly on its license plates, New Hampshire has really shown its independent streak by electing a group of six women to run the state for the coming years.?\n\n\t?\n\n\tAs reported in the Huffington Post:?\"Joining New Hampshire Senate incumbents Jeanne Shaheen (D) and Kelly Ayotte (R) are three newly elected women:?Gov.
