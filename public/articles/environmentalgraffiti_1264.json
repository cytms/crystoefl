Pamukkale, in south western Turkey, is a natural mineral-bath spa first built by the Romans around a sacred hot spring and still open to the public as the Sacred Pool today. Let\u2019s find out more about this natural phenomenon and see some stunning pictures.\nHow can this not be a winter wonderland?Photo: \nImage: yasushi00\nWhat exactly happens at Pamukkale? The calcium-laden water from natural hot springs cascades over a cliff and forms the incredible white terraces that look like they're decorated with stalactites. They are travertines, actually, calcium deposits frozen in stone as the water cools in the open and the calcium separates and attaches to the soil.\nChalk terraces:Photo: \nImage: Patrick-Emil Z?rner\nThe hot springs are said to be more than 2,000 years old and the Romans first built the spa city at Hierapolis, capitalising on the natural beauty and the hot springs\u2019 health benefits. A visitor to Pamukkale in 1967 remembers the springs: \nSoon, word of Pamukkale\u2019s beauty spread and the number of visitors increased: They came by car, bus and taxi; first from neighboring cities, then from further away and even abroad. The village at the foot of the \"cotton castle\" (Pamukkale's translation from Turkish) turned into a proper town in no time, with tea and snack stalls, restaurants, hotels and motels to accommodate the growing number of overnight visitors.  \nThe town of Pamukkale at the foot of the hot springs today:Photo: \nImage: Kitkatcrazy\nPhoto: \nImage: Michael Frey\nUnfortunately, as is often the case, too much attention is not always a good thing. The only road connecting the hot springs with the world ended right next to them, causing a lot of pollution. People even rode bikes and motorbikes up and down the slopes. Hot water from the springs was used to fill hotel pools and waste water collected in the springs\u2019 pools, turning them brownish. Some visitors walked around in the springs with their shoes on and others mistook them for private bathtubs and washed themselves in them with soap and shampoo. Soon, Pamukkale lost its glory and attracted fewer visitors. \nThe hot springs of Pamukkale:Photo: \nImage: Mila Zinkova \nThis was Pamukkale\u2019s unprotected state until the Pamukkale-Hierapolis area was declared a World Heritage Site in 1988. In the 1990s, local authorities undertook a development project that restricted access to the site and imposed restrictions on visitors. Though some of the measures might not be ideal \u2013 the drop-off point is quite far from the springs and no transport is provided \u2013 at least efforts are being made to protect this unique site and to restore its former glory. Pamukkale is still very much worth a trip.   \nPamukkale boasts many Roman ruins, here the amphitheatre:Photo: \nImage: Joonas Plaan\nMore structured fun today:Photo: \nImage: Ivar Abrahamsen\nSunset over the Pamukkale terraces: Photo: \nImage: Wolfgang Beyer\nSources: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
