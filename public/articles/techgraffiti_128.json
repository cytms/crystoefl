Already a sports car, which has a top speed of 150mph, and goes from 0 \u2013 62 mph in just four seconds, has been built from hemp, potatoes and rapeseed.\nBen Woods, research engineer for Warwick University, recently showed his biodegradable sports car at the Science Museum in London. Dr Kerry Kirwan, an assistant professor at the university, says he started building biodegradable racing cars because people thought environmentally friendly products were boring.\nThe bodywork of the sports car, Eco One, is made from hemp and it is held together with a resin made from plant oils. The tyres are made from about 1.5% potato starch, which replaces some of the fossil fuels. The break pads are made from cashew nut shells, and they use bioethanol as the fuel, made from wheat and plant oil. Its engine and chassis are steel, which can be easily recycled. The whole car is 95% biodegradable or recyclable.\nDr Kirwan and his team have not yet decided exactly what materials to use for the Formula One car, but are planning to include \u201ctropical fibres\u201d, which include coconuts. They hope that their research will set an example for the motor industry. Woods comments,\nNick Fry, team principal of Honda Racing, says:\nUnfortunately for the environment it\u2019s global transport: getting the cars and the people to and from the F1 races which is the biggest contributor to carbon emissions.\nIf you want to find out all the latest racing news, why not subcribe to our RSS feed, we\u2019ll even throw in a free album.","author":"emma","web_category":"productsgear","title":"The World's First Biodegradable F1 Car","picture_url":"http://7.thumbs.techgraffiti.com/1/2013/01/Taylor-aerocar.jpg","url":"http://www.techgraffiti.com/news-worlds-first-biodegradable-f1-car"}
