McChrystal is not the first high-profile confrontation between a military commander and his civilian commander-in-chief. The most famous one occurred nearly six decades before Rolling Stone published the general\u2019s disparaging remarks about Obama and other top officials. On April 11, 1951, one year into the Korean War, President Harry S. Truman relieved GeneralDouglas MacArthur of command of the U.S. forces in Korea. As commentators and historians draw the inevitable parallels between the two situations, it is worth revisiting this historic conflict and how it unfolded.\nBy the time Truman gave MacArthur his walking papers, tensions between the two men had been brewing for months. In the early days of the war in Korea, General MacArthur had devised some brilliant strategies and military maneuvers that helped save South Korea from falling to the invading forces of communist North Korea. As U.S. and United Nations forces turned the tide of battle in Korea, MacArthur argued for a policy of pushing into North Korea to completely defeat the communist forces.\nTruman went along with this plan, but worried that the communist government of the People\u2019s Republic of China might take the invasion as a hostile act and intervene in the conflict. In October 1950, MacArthur met with Truman and assured him that the chances of a Chinese intervention were slim. Then, in November and December 1950, hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops crossed into North Korea and flung themselves against the American lines, driving the U.S. troops back into South Korea. MacArthur then asked for permission to bomb communist China and use Nationalist Chinese forces from Taiwan against the People\u2019s Republic of China. Truman, determined to pursue a policy of \u201climited war\u201d in Korea, flatly refused these requests, and a very public argument began to develop between the two men, ultimately leading to MacArthur\u2019s dismissal.\nAfter firing MacArthur, Truman gave a speech explaining his actions to the American public. He began by defending his overall policy in Korea, declaring, \u201cIt is right for us to be in Korea.\u201d He excoriated the \u201ccommunists in the Kremlin [who] are engaged in a monstrous conspiracy to stamp out freedom all over the world.\u201d Nevertheless, he explained, it \u201cwould be wrong-tragically wrong-for us to take the initiative in extending the war. \u2026Our aim is to avoid the spread of the conflict.\u201d The president continued, \u201cI believe that we must try to limit the war to Korea for these vital reasons: To make sure that the precious lives of our fighting men are not wasted; to see that the security of our country and the free world is not needlessly jeopardized; and to prevent a third world war.\u201d General MacArthur had been relieved, he continued, \u201cso that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of our policy.\u201d\nMacArthur\u2019s dismissal set off a brief uproar in the United States as well as in Japan, where he had overseen economic and health reforms while serving as the supreme commander of the Allied occupation after World War II. The general returned to the United States to a hero\u2019s welcome. Parades were held in his honor, and he was asked to give a farewell address to the U.S. Congress. At the end of his now-famous speech, he said, \u201cI still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barracks ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that old soldiers never die; they just fade away. And like the old soldier of that ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty.\u201d\nMacArthur and McChrystal are not the only generals in American history who came?into conflict with the commander-in-chief. In the so-called \u201cConway Cabal\u201d affair during the American Revolution, Brigadier General Thomas Conway wrote a series of letters criticizing George Washington. One of them, in which he called the commander \u201cweak,\u201d was forwarded to Washington, who wrote a reply that expressed his displeasure. A week later, Conway submitted his letter of resignation to the Continental Congress. During the Civil War, General George McClellan drew Abraham Lincoln\u2019s ire when he refused to go on the offensive against the Confederate Army. Their disagreement inspired one of Lincoln\u2019s best-known quotes: \u201cIf General McClellan does not want to use the army, I would like to borrow it for a time.\u201d McClellan, for his part, made little effort to hide his disdain for the president, referring to him as \u201cnothing more than a well-meaning baboon\u201d and pretending to be in bed when Lincoln visited his home. In November 1862, Lincoln removed him from command, a decision that prompted a number of loyal officers to resign in protest.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Obama Fires McChrystal: Echoes of Truman-MacArthur?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_171_16.png","url":"http://www.history.com/news/obama-fires-mcchrystal-echoes-of-truman-macarthur"}
