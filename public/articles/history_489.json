The precious trove was discovered by scholars who specialize in the history of Monticello, the extraordinary former estate of American\u2019s third president.\n\u201cOur discovery provides an amazing and intimate look into Jefferson\u2019s world,\u201d said Leslie Greene Bowman, president of Monticello and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which operates the site. \u201cTo find his handwritten notations is like peering over Jefferson\u2019s shoulder to see his mind at work.\u201d\nThe collection boasts several noteworthy volumes, including architecture manuals Jefferson used while designing the University of Virginia, which, like Monticello, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It also features works by classical authors such as Aristotle and Plutarch.\nThe books were donated to the school along with thousands of others following the 1880 death of Jefferson\u2019s granddaughter, Ellen Wayles Randolph Coolidge, and her husband, Joseph Coolidge. At the time, nobody knew that the collection contained volumes the Coolidges had purchased from Jefferson\u2019s estate after his death in 1826, when his books were auctioned off to settle debts on Monticello.\nMonticello scholars tracked down the collection after finding a letter about the sale and an 1880 article about the Coolidges\u2019 donation to Washington University. Recently, a group of them traveled to St. Louis to verify that the books had indeed been in the possession of the Declaration of Independence\u2019s primary author. Among other striking pieces of evidence, they stumbled across his scrawl in an architecture book and a scrap of paper with notes written in Greek in his hand.\n\u201cWashington University is thrilled to have secured and preserved these volumes since 1880,\u201d said Shirley K. Baker, vice chancellor for scholarly resources and dean of libraries at Washington University. \u201cIt is particularly appropriate that these books should be here in Missouri. It was Jefferson who acquired this land in the Louisiana Purchase, and St. Louis was the jumping-off point for the expedition Jefferson sent to explore the new territory.\u201d\nFor more information, watch a video about the discovery or read the press release issued by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation and Washington University.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"Trove of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Books Discovered","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/images/topic/content/inline/jefferson_plutarch.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/trove-of-thomas-jeffersons-books-discovered"}
