Tigers begin to eat meat at three months old.\nIndonesian tigers and orangutans are both endangered species, threatened by rapidly shrinking habitats.\nConservationists estimate there are fewer than 700 Sumatran tigers still alive, while fewer than 60,000 orangutans remain in the wild. Around 90 percent of the jungle has been destroyed by illegal logging, poaching and cut-and-burn farming practices on Borneo and Sumatra islands.\nIn related news, a Chinese surgeon recently removed cataracts from a baby tiger at the Nanchang zoo.\nvia Associated Press, Reuters and the BBC\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Baby tigers and baby orangutans become the best of friends ","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Tiger_in_the_water.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/baby-tigers-and-baby-urangutans-become-the-best-of-friends-pics/301"}
