After backing his close friend William Howard Taft to serve as his successor, he disappeared on an extended hunting trip to Africa. But Roosevelt became increasingly disillusioned with Taft and eventually decided to mount a challenge for the next Republican nomination. \u201cMy hat is in the ring,\u201d Roosevelt declared in February 1912. \u201cThe fight is on and I am stripped to the buff.\u201d\nWith few exceptions, candidates in prior elections had largely refrained from overt campaigning. Roosevelt changed this by giving speeches around the country, especially in the dozen states with direct primaries. He called Taft a \u201cfathead\u201d with \u201cthe brains of a guinea pig,\u201d and Taft responded in kind, saying Roosevelt\u2019s followers were \u201cradicals\u201d and \u201cneurotics.\u201d \u201cRoosevelt felt it was hard to sit on the sidelines when this guy was messing up,\u201d said Alan Lessoff, a history professor at Illinois State University who specializes in the Progressive Era. \u201cAnd Taft was no slouch, so he resented it terribly.\u201d\nThough Roosevelt won most of the primaries, he came up short of delegates at the tumultuous Republican National Convention in Chicago, prompting him and his supporters to storm out. They then reconvened across town and formed the Progressive Party, nicknamed the Bull Moose Party because Roosevelt said he felt as fit as a bull moose.\nMeanwhile, at the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson managed to outlast Speaker of the House Champ Clark, winning the nomination on the 46th ballot. \u201cHe was a fresh face, an articulate guy, mildly progressive, southern roots, northern background,\u201d Lewis L. Gould, author of \u201cFour Hats in the Ring: The 1912 Election and the Birth of Modern American Politics,\u201d said of Wilson. Rounding out the field was Eugene Debs, who was running for the third straight time on the Socialist Party ticket.\nIn the run-up to the November election, Taft essentially gave up as a candidate, complaining in a letter that \u201cthere are so many people in the country who don\u2019t like me.\u201d To make matters worse, Vice President James S. Sherman died in office that October, temporarily leaving him without a running mate.\nAll three other candidates hit the stump aggressively, particularly Roosevelt, who traveled some 10,000 miles and visited 34 states, where he spoke out in favor of Progressive Era causes such as minimum wage laws, conservation, women\u2019s suffrage, safer workplaces, the eight-hour workday and regulating but not destroying monopolies. At one point, he was shot before an appearance in Milwaukee, yet he still managed to speak for about 90 minutes with a bullet lodged in his chest.\nIn the end, Roosevelt ran one of the most successful third-party candidacies in history. But with the Republican Party split, Wilson\u2014who had based his campaign on completely smashing monopolies and tariff reduction\u2014became the first Democrat since Grover Cleveland to take the White House. He prevailed with 42 percent of the popular vote (435 electoral votes), compared to 27 percent (88 electoral votes) for Roosevelt and 23 percent (eight electoral votes) for Taft. Debs didn\u2019t get any electoral votes, but he garnered 6 percent of the popular vote\u2014the most ever for a Socialist presidential candidate.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most distinguished field that has ever run for president in modern times,\u201d said Gould, who added that the consequences of the election were profound. The Republican Party, for instance, would never be the same. \u201cEver since the 1912 campaign, the conservatives in the Republican Party have had the upper hand,\u201d Lessoff said. \u201cBut what it means to be a conservative has changed quite a bit. You can\u2019t draw a straight line.\u201d","author":"Jesse  Greenspan","web_category":"news","title":"Remembering the 1912 Presidential Election","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/1912-election.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/remembering-the-1912-presidential-election"}
