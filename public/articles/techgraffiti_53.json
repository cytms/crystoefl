And if you opted for the traditional cycle rickshaw, no doubt the guilts soon set in at the thought of the person pulling the thing busting a gut for you. If these scenes sound familiar you\u2019ll be happy to know it\u2019s soon set to change.\nImage: pangalactic garbleblaster\nEnter the solar-powered rickshaw. Dubbed the Soleckshaw, the new-age solar-electric vehicle was recently wheeled into the limelight in Delhi. The dual-powered cycle is operated both by a solar-charged battery and by pedal power. The result is a significant ease on the strain of the poor man normally chugging away at the wheel.\nFour Soleckshaws will ply routes near to their solar battery re-charge stations \u2013 leaving a carbon tyreprint of zero \u2013 with more advanced versions to be launched ready for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in the city.\nThe New Soleckshaw\nDespite a top speed of 15kph, the Soleckshaw was almost pipped to the post in its zero-emission urban transport heat by the sleek-looking SolarCab, word of which emerged earlier this year.

There, cities suffer from higher levels of air pollution, caused largely by vehicle emissions, while using rickshaws is less a novel idea than an ever-present reality \u2013 not least for their pullers sweating under the sun.\nSource 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
