This is because a new super efficient light bulb is being developed. Experts have found a way to make Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) brighter and use less power than energy efficient light bulbs currently on the market.\nThe technology, used in gadgets such as mobile phones and computers, had previously not been powerful enough to be used for lighting. But Glasgow University scientists think they\u2019ve soleved this problem.\nThe Institute of Photonics at the University of Strathclyde, has developed a project which involves making microscopic holes in the surface of LEDs to increase the level of light they give off. And it has the nifty name of nano-imprint lithography.\nDr Faiz Rahman, who is leading the project, said:\n\n\nBad news for the humble light bulb, but excellent news if you\u2019re a light bulb scientist and are looking for a job \u2013 get yourselves to Glasgow!\nIf you want to find out all the latest lightbulb news, why not subcribe to our RSS feed, we'll even throw in a free album.\n\n ","author":"emma","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Lights Out For The Lightbulb","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/http-inlinethumb38.webshots.com-45925-2038641700105101600S600x600Q85.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/green-living/lights-out-for-the-lightbulb/658"}
