According to longstanding claims about Whitehead that appeared in a contemporary article in the Bridgeport Herald, he successfully flew his plane, known as No. 21 or \u201cThe Condor,\u201d early on the morning of August 14, 1901, achieving a flight of some 1.5 miles at a height of 150 feet in the skies over Bridgeport.\nIn March, Australian aviation historian John Brown revealed what he considers to be photographic proof of this \u201cfirst\u201d flight, in the form of a blown-up image of a long-missing photograph of Whitehead actually flying his plane. Contemporary reports of a 1906 aviation exhibition in New York mention the Whitehead photograph as part of the collection. When Brown discovered a panoramic photograph of the exhibit in the attic of a museum in Bavaria (where he was working for a German aircraft construction company), he was able to identify the missing photograph on the wall by enlarging the image by some 3,500 percent. As a result of Brown\u2019s research, the well-known aviation publication Jane\u2019s All the World\u2019s Aircraft endorsed Whitehead as first in flight in its 100th anniversary issue this spring.\nHowever, historians at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, where the Wright brothers\u2019 famous Flyer has been on display since 1948, remain highly skeptical of Brown\u2019s claims. They point to the fact that not one of Whitehead\u2019s flying machines built post-1902 ever left the ground, and maintain that the original newspaper account documenting Whitehead\u2019s flight exaggerated his achievements, while other newspapers simply reprinted the story without confirmation. The photograph on which Brown builds his case, moreover, is simply too blurry to provide definitive proof of anything.\nBrown and fellow proponents of Whitehead\u2019s claim to the \u201cfirst in flight\u201d status have countered that the Smithsonian is bound by the terms of a contract with the Wright estate stating that the museum will lose the Flyer if they recognize anyone other than Orville and Wilbur Wright as having made the first successful powered flight. Though the museum has acknowledged that such a contract exists, its officials vigorously maintain they would not let it stand in the way of a historical fact\u2014if such a fact could be established definitively, which in this case it has not.\nBut such skepticism has not stopped many in Connecticut from celebrating what they see as Whitehead\u2019s historic achievement. \u201cOur license plate should say \u2018firster in flight,\u2019\u201d said Bill Finch, the mayor of Bridgeport, after Jane\u2019s All the World\u2019s Aircraft endorsed Brown\u2019s new research in March. And at Chip\u2019s Family Restaurant, breakfast specials like the \u201cNo. 21,\u201d a hamburger omelet served with German apple pancakes, attest to locals\u2019 enthusiasm for Connecticut\u2019s new claim to fame. Now, with their passage of House Bill No. 6671, Connecticut senators have decided to make Whitehead\u2019s place in history\u2014at least in their state\u2013official.","author":"Sarah  Pruitt","web_category":"news","title":"In Connecticut, Wright Brothers No Longer \u201cFirst in Flight\u201d","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wrightbrothers.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/in-connecticut-wright-brothers-no-longer-first-in-flight"}
