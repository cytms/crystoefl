There\u2019s fishing, boating, camping, biking, hiking, ballooning and not to forget the many scenic wineries. We\u2019ve found some lake reflections that make already beautiful scenery even more stunning.  \nPerfect mirror at Honeoye Lake:Photo: \nImage: Jules Zysman\nThe Finger Lakes originated as a series of northward-flowing rivers and were formed over the last two million years by glacial carvings of old stream valleys. The longest ones, Lake Seneca and Lake Cayuga, are among the deepest in North America and go below sea level, to 618 feet (188 m) and 435 feet (133 m), respectively. \nView to the bottom of the sky at Canandeigua Lake:Photo: \nImage: Lauren Mackson\nOne wouldn\u2019t necessarily connect New York State, known for its harsh winters, with wine production. But the Finger Lakes are an ideal local for wineries because of their mild climate, even in winter when the lake effect causes warmer lake water to reduce the chill for surrounding areas. This residual summer warmth protects the grapes from spring frost and early frost before the harvest. A similar phenomenon can be observed in Long Island, also a surprising location for wineries, as it profits from the ocean effect.   \nThe Glenora outlet at Seneca Lake:Photo: \nImage: Eflon\nBurkett Mills behind the Main Bridge in Penn Yan:Photo: \nImage: vincenzooli\nThe individual lakes of the Finger Lakes are named after Native American tribes, most of them belonging to the Iroquois. Here are the lakes from west to east and their meanings: \n1. Conesus \u2013 \u201cAlways Beautiful\u201d\n2. Hemlock \u2013 the only lake not named by the Native Americans\n3. Canadice \u2013 \u201cLong Lake\u201d\n4. Honeoye \u2013 \u201cFinger Lying\u201d, the shallowest of the lakes\n5. Canandaigua \u2013 \u201cChosen Spot\u201d\n6.

One can clearly make out how the snow cover cannot persist along the largest lakes, Cayuga and Seneca, because their shorelines are slightly warmer due to lake temperatures being higher than air or land temperatures.  \nThe Finger Lakes as seen from Space:Photo: \nImage: NASA\nFor those inspired to make a trip, a great way to experience much of the Finger Lakes\u2019 wildlife and natural beauty is to stay at a campground in one of the many state parks. Hiking trails start in front of your tent and lead you to the region\u2019s many gorges and waterfalls.  \nEmerson Park at Owasco Lake:Photo: \nImage: Lida Rose\n\nSources: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
