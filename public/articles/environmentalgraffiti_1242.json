Many are decorated with elaborate white friezes and patterns so typical for the region. The town\u2019s remoteness and narrow streets suggest a close-knit community that might, in times of invasions, have allowed outsiders to enter yet not necessarily to leave\u2026 \nThe hilltop houses and narrow streets close-up:Photo: \nImage: pringle2004\n\u2026 and the same scene further to the right, the edge of town:Photo: \nImage: Bellosta\nToday though, Al Hajjara, also spelled Al Hajarah or Al Hajjerah, is a city that greets visitors who brave the trek from the capital Sana\u2019a, about 25 miles northwest, with friendly smiles and insights into their culture. Dance is what the inhabitants of the Hazar Mountains are especially known for. And, not surprisingly, stone is what the city's all about - hajjar means stone in Arabic - it being built on top of a rock and out of stone. \nPanoramic view of Al Hajjara with cactus:Photo: \nImage via girlsoloinarabia\nThe Haraz Mountains are perfect for hiking, an activity best undertaken with a local guide to translate in the many villages and explain Yemeni culture and history. Though Sana\u2019a\u2019s climate is moderate, the area around it is known for its high temperature ranges: peak temperatures can be 30 degrees Celsius during the day and fall to 0 degrees Celsius at night.  \nUnpainted, the houses would just blend into the landscape:Photo: \nImage: Franco Pecchio\nThe narrow streets of Al Hajjara:Photo: \nImage: pringle2004\nThe western highlands receive the highest rainfall in Arabia and this is where Yemen\u2019s agriculture takes place; the landscape is therefore heavily terraced. Popular crops are sorghum, cotton and fruit trees \u2013 mangoes are the most sought after. Even if you have never been to Yemen, you might have tasted its most famous export \u2013 Mocha! Yemeni coffee is made from ancient variations of coffee arabica grown nowhere else and processed the way it has been for centuries. \nAgricultural terraces just below Al Hajjara:Photo: \nImage via traveladventures\nThe central highlands are drier due to their elevation \u2013 the area is a wide plateau at 2,000 m (6,560 ft) \u2013 but still receive sufficient rain during most years to grow crops like wheat and barley. Stored rain water is used  for irrigation as Yemen has no permanent rivers, only wadis or river valleys that are dry in the summer.  \nA typical Haraz Mountain village close to Manakha, an ancient stronghold:Photo: \nImage: Franco Pecchio\nDepending on the region, houses in Yemen were predominantly built with clay (in the north and dry east) or stone (in the west and central highlands). Great pride is taken in building a house and once finished, it is often decorated with calligraphic writing chronicling the event. Windows are often the most decorative element with date palm motifs, dots, zigzag lines or floral designs. Though houses vary from region to region, their particular building style is unique to Yemen. \nSmall houses to the left, skyscrapers to the right:Photo: \nImage: Bruno Befreetv \nBuilding on top of rocks seems a national sport in Yemen, here the Imam's Palace or Dar al-Hajar rock house in Whadi Dhahr:Photo: \nImage: Franco Pecchio\nTraditional building style in Sana\u2019a:Photo: \nImage: Tyabji\nSana'a is said to have been founded by Noah\u2019s son Shem not far from the mountain where the ark washed ashore after the flood. At up to 10,000 years old, Yemenis thus proudly claim it to be the oldest living city in the world. Though never easy to reach, tucked away in the mountains, Sana\u2019a soon earned the nickname \"Hidden Jewel of Arabia\" because of its beautiful buildings and well-stocked markets. Let's hope it'll remain tucked away a wee bit longer and its building style preserved unscathed by modern influences.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
