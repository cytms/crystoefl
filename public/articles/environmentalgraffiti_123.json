Many of them are endemic to the island they come from and are threatened. A new report from TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, has found that Thailand is selling huge amounts of threatened reptiles and amphibians to local as well as global markets.\nPhoto: M.Todd/TRAFFIC Southeast AsiaThe red variant of Panther Chameleon, originating from Nosy Mangabe, Madagascar. This morph is highly sought after due to its striking colouration. Male specimen observed in trade at a dealer\u2019s house in Saraburi city, Thailand, January 2010.\nTRAFFIC's report, Trade in Malagasy Reptiles and Amphibians in Thailand, showed that the biggest problem was trade in Madagascar's endemic chameleons. Two hundred and thirty-three chameleons from 16 species were found for sale.\nPhoto: M.Todd/TRAFFIC Southeast AsiaMalagasy amphibians are currently growing in popularity in Thailand. The Madagascan Horned Frogs shown above were encountered at an aquarium shop in Wong Wen Yai, Bangkok, January 2010. \nOddly, official trade data showed that in 2005 Lebanon legally imported only 32 Madagascan chameleons from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora member countries. Now, there is some legal importation, but 3,738 chameleons were supposedly imported to Thailand from Khazakhstan (which shows as importing no reptiles) or re-exported from Lebanon.\nPhoto: M.Todd/TRAFFIC Southeast AsiaIncreasing demand for amphibians was reported by dealers and clients. This Madagascan spotted Treefrog was on sale at Chatuchak Market, January 2010. \n\u201cEven at the highest theoretical hatching and survival rates, it is impossible for 32 chameleons to produce the thousands of offspring Thailand declared as imported from Lebanon in subsequent years, so how is the shortfall accounted for?\u201d asks Chris Shepherd, Deputy Director of TRAFFIC, South East Asia.\nPhoto: M.Todd/TRAFFIC Southeast AsiaDehydrated Carpet Chameleons offered for sale by a private dealer in Wat Lao, Bangkok, January 2010. \nIt isn't just chameleons at risk and being sold either. Other species that are classified by the IUCN as critically endangered and identified in the report include one hundred radiated tortoises, dozens of spider tortoises and three ploughshare tortoises \u2013 three of the rarest tortoise species in the world. Trade in all of the above is banned. The radiated tortoise now has 70% less numbers than in 2009.\nCrawford Allan, Regional Director, TRAFFIC North America, explains: \"The unique wildlife of Madagascar is being put at risk to satisfy the desire of some collectors who want to own a rare 'living jewel' from the forest. Collectors in the United States should be careful before buying Madagascar\u2019s reptiles or chameleons imported from Thailand, even if they are alleged to be captive bred.\"\nPhoto: M.Todd/TRAFFIC Southeast AsiaThe commonly traded Panther Chameleon Furcifer pardalis exhibiting turquoise base colour consistent with specimens from Nosy Be, Madagascar. Male specimen encountered in trade in the UK, August 2009. \nLuckily, officials are on the lookout at Bangkok airport. Just recently, Thai authorities caught 800 protected reptiles being smuggled out, but the number of those with false 'passports' showing them as being legally imported is still huge.\nPhoto: M.Todd/TRAFFIC Southeast AsiaPanther Chameleons are widely encountered in Thailand\u2019s reptile trade. Female specimen encountered in trade at a dealer\u2019s house in Saraburi city, Thailand, January 2010. \n\u201cSeizures of Madagascan chameleons by airport authorities are testament to the continuing illegal trade, but as the current report amply demonstrates, only through making regular visits to markets stalls and other vendors can we hope to unearth the true scale of the illicit trade and its potential impact on wild chameleon populations,\u201d said Dr Richard Jenkins, Chair of the IUCN/SSC Chameleon Specialist Group.\nPhoto: M.Todd/TRAFFIC Southeast AsiaFalse Tomato Frog encountered at an aquatics shop in Dao Khanong, Bangkok, January 2010. \nThere needs to be a continuous crackdown on this illegal and immoral trade in endangered species. The World Wildlife Fund and other organizations such as TRAFFIC are doing their best, but what is really needed is a refusal on people's parts to buy these 'pets' and so dry up the exportation and exploitation that way.","author":"Michele Collet","web_category":"nature","title":"Thai Pet Dealers Trading in Critically Endangered Animals","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/1Snakeinbasketjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-thailand-pet-dealers-supplying-critically-endangered-animals"}
