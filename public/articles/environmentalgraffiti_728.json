But these slimy creatures actually deserve our respect as they can do what humans will never achieve \u2013 walk on water! And we\u2019re talking its liquid form here, not ice. Let\u2019s how these amazing creatures manage such a feat. \nThough we mostly make the acquaintance of land snails in our gardens and parks, don\u2019t be fooled, as marine snails are far more common and can be found anywhere from freshwater ponds to brackish water to the abyssal depths of the ocean. The whole class of Gastropoda that includes snails and slugs is second only to insects when it comes to diversity. \nA water snail in its element:Photo: \nImage via MSNBC\nFor the longest time, snails walking on water seemed almost miraculous even to scientists but a study in last fall\u2019s issue of the Physics of Fluids journal shed some light on the matter. After reviewing video material of water snails, the scientists, led by Eric Lauga of the University of California, San Diego, came to the conclusion that the snail\u2019s ability to create small rippling movements with its foot causes the traction it needs to move across the slippery surface. It's similar to humans walking on ice. \nA water snail walking on water, upside down!Photo: \nImage via Mr. Barlow \nExplains Dr. Lauga: \u201cThe snails' ability to move depends on water's tendency for its surface to resist disturbance. Water \u2018wants\u2019 to stay flat.\u201d The snail\u2019s ripples create similar ripples on the water\u2019s surface that generate a downward force as the water tries to calm itself. But the water\u2019s ripples need to have the right size so that the snail doesn't slip as would be the case with ripples that are too small. Big ripples would prevent the snail from grabbing them. \nBlack marine snails hanging upside down:Photo: \nImage: David Hu & Brian Chan\nThe insights these propulsion possibilities provide will not lead to inventions humans can use immediately, such as water-walking shoes (each shoe would have to be several times larger than a football field to distribute our weight). Theoretically, however, the possibilities are endless. \nWhat's more, the first slimy steps were already taken a few years ago: Mechanical engineer Anette Hosoi and her team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology created RoboSnail, a battery-powered imitation. \nNot pretty, but we get the idea \u2013 RoboSnail:Photo: \nImage via MIT\nSpeculates Dr. Lauga: \nNow that\u2019s a thought! So next time you encounter a snail, show it some respect. Because, as this last picture shows, they\u2019re one cool species that can do amazing things. \nLand snail scaling a blade of grass:Photo: \nImage: Sean Mack\nSource: 1, 2, 3, 4\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
