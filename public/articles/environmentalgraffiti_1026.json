More than 4,000 wild horses have already been slaughtered in Carnarvon National Park.  The Courier Mail newspaper reported the slaughter and the plan to kill the rest of the horses on Saturday. The newspaper accused the government of trying to cover up the cull by instructing the shooters to hide the bodies.  \nAndrew McNamara, State Sustainability Director, said that a cull of the horses was the most humane option available.  He said: \"Feral horses are causing serious erosion, spreading weeds, destroying freshwater springs and other water courses, damaging Aboriginal cultural sites, competing with native wildlife for feed, and destroying habitat.\"\nMcNamara said the aim of the program was to keep the horse population at a manageable level.  There are around 100,000 wild horses in Queensland and their presence has caused damage to native ecosystems.  The RSPCA reported that it gave its support to the horse cull, but stated its desire that fertility control had been used instead. \nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"Chris","web_category":"nature","title":"Queensland to Slaughter 10,000 Wild Horses","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/800px-Thylacinepouchjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/queensland-to-slaughter-10000-wild-horses/452"}
