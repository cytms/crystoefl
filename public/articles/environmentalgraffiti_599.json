Gone!\nWhen the female Harbor seals are ready for breeding (meaning their pups are newly-weaned), the males \"gather underwater, turn belly-side up, put their heads together and vocalize\" (Wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor_Seal). \nFemales find this irresistible. \nEleven months later, the pups are born \u2013 one pup per female. While the male Harbor Seals \"discuss\" who's the biggest and baddest, the mothers alternate between fishing, beach-sunbathing, rolling on their backs to expose their bellies so their baby can nurse, and sleeping.\nPhoto: Mila Zinkova\nSometimes when the pups are learning how to swim (no, it isn't instinctive like flying is to birds), the mother will let her pup stay on her back while she dives.\nMost Harbor Seals stay relatively close to land, hauling out onto beaches, rocky slabs, even buoys and docks. \nPhoto: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nFish are the prey they enjoy the most \u2013 particularly herring, flounder, anchovy and codfish. The males can weigh up to about 308 pounds; females up to 175 pounds.\nHarbor seals can live as long as 30 years or more.\n","author":"dorothydot","web_category":"nature","title":"The Seal: One of  the Cutest Animals on Earth","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Island9.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/animals/news-cutest-animal"}
