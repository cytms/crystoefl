Now it\u2019s the turn of the bees","advice_category":"2","content":"\nPhoto: Photo: Dixie Native\nFrom bikes to trucks, we\u2019ve featured more than a few unfortunate folks on EG who look like they\u2019re loaded up to a more than uncomfortable degree. We\u2019ve even shown ants looking like they could use a lightening of their loads. Now it\u2019s the turn of the bees. \nPhoto: Photo: johnkimbler.com\nWhile our buzzing buddies don\u2019t need to be as strong in the lifting department as their antsy cousins, when these insects are collecting pollen they can still look more than a little encumbered.\nPhoto: Photo: johnkimbler.com\nThere are over 20,000 known species of bees on the planet, and despite threats to their numbers our honey happy friends are found in every habitat that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. Hey, they\u2019re one of the insects par excellence in the pollinating stakes!\nPhoto: Photo: Gu?rin Nicolas \nA fact not everyone may know is that bees don\u2019t just feed on the nectar that gives them energy. No, they\u2019re quite partial to the pollen itself too, which like the meat in one\u2019s sandwich, gives them \u2013 and more importantly their larvae \u2013 protein for growing plus other nutrients.\nPhoto: Photo: Eli Shany\nBees are quite single-minded in what they want. They tend to focus either on gathering pollen or on gathering nectar, with deliberate pollen-gatherers proving the more efficient pollinators. Incredibly, an estimated one third of the human food supply rests on the tiny shoulders of the bee, particularly the domesticated European honey bee. \nPhoto: Photo: johnkimbler.com\nBut it\u2019s not the shoulders of the bee that really shoulder the burden. The characteristic that makes bees look more loveable than most insects to our mammalian eyes \u2013 their fuzziness \u2013 is actually part of nature\u2019s design to make them the exceptional pollinators that they are. Because most bees are fuzzy, they carry an electrostatic charge which helps the pollen to stick. \nPhoto: Photo: johnkimbler.com\nStill it\u2019s the mass of stiff hairs called the scopa or pollen basket that we more commonly associate with the pollen carrying prowess of bees. Female bees regularly stop foraging to groom themselves \u2013 like the ladies they are \u2013 brushing back the pollen and packing it into their moistened pollen basket, which is usually to be found on their legs but occasionally on their abdomens.\nPhoto: Photo: Jon Sullivan \nBack at the ranch \u2013 sorry, hive \u2013 the bees mix the pollen and nectar together to form a typically soupy mass that\u2019s moulded into various shapes and stored in a small chamber ready to be munched on by hatching larvae.\nPhoto: Photo: Muhammad Mahdi Karim\nEspecially when weighed down with heavy loads, travelling between flowers can be a dangerous game for bees. As well as assassin bugs and crab spiders lurking in petals, bees also have be on the lookout for birds in flight \u2013 and all while winging around like overladen cargo planes. \nPhoto: Photo: Herr S \nSources: 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
