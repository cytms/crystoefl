In fact, groups who want the greater society to address environmental issues have been around since before the Second World War. \nAfter the war, and with the growth of technical advances, the strong beliefs of these organisations were seen as \u2018hippy\u2019 and too liberal. \nThe media portrayed the campaigners as activists who just promoted free love and peace, not as true advocates of sustainable resources. Society took no notice and in a way, who could blame them. The war with its rations had forced people to mend and make do, but afterwards there was consumer choice like never before. In the UK Neville Chamberlain had started this drive towards socialism and \u2018keeping up with the Jones\u2019\u2019, and with money in their pockets, this is what the consumer wanted to do.\nPhoto: Francesco Marino\nWith an on-credit attitude and technology advances, manufactures reaped the benefits by providing less expensive products, with short life-spans, forcing the consumer to buy more, putting it all on credit. \nAll the time the consumer was buying the next best thing, the global climate was shifting around them. Activities that produce and destroy these goods are causing excessive greenhouse-gas emissions which are warming up the earth. \nThe result is extreme weather, failed crops, rise in sea level and health crises; which finally led worldwide governments to take notice of the scientists and \u2018hippies\u2019.\nGovernments are now supporting communities that take early action to reduce their carbon footprint and the impact of global warming/climate change on the planet. \nThe UK Government published the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan White Paper on 15 July 2009, setting out plans to cut emissions for industry, workplace, home and farming.\nThe transition plan aims to cut emissions from homes by 29% on 2008 levels by:\n\u2022\tRolling out smart meters in every home by the end of 2020.\n\n\u2022\tPiloting \u2018pay as you save\u2019 ways to help people make their whole house greener \u2013 the savings made on energy bills will be used to repay the up-front costs.\n\n\u2022\tIntroducing clean energy cash-back schemes so that people and businesses will be paid if they use low-carbon sources to generate heat or electricity.\nAll well and good, but not many average householders will see this funding. The global financial crisis has also hit the average person, with pay freezes and redundancies meaning there is very little extra money to spend re-doing the loft insulation or giving to charities to help foreign countries lower their emissions. \nSo what can the average householder do to save money, without breaking their budget?\nPhoto: djcodrin\nTips for the House:\nTurn the heating down\nGrow your own food\nSwitch off appliances\nMake your own draft excluders\nHome energy check: by filling in a form you will receive a personalised form offering advice on where you can save money and energy.\nHomebase Interactive Energy House: a 3D virtual house that you can stroll around.
