The largest known specimen, unearthed in Norway in 2008, measured 50 feet in length and boasted teeth the size of cucumbers. The newly described skull, found by a local fossil collector in southwest England in 1994, is roughly 7 feet long, meaning the original animal stretched 30 feet, said Judyth Sassoon, a University of Bristol scientist who led the project and co-wrote the paper. It remained in the collection of the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery following its discovery.\n\u201cWhen I saw it for the first time three years ago, I was instantly fascinated by some of the unusual markings on the lower and upper jaws,\u201d Sassoon recalled. \u201cAt the time the fossil still needed to be extracted from the clay matrix in which it was discovered, and the museum staff kindly helped with that daunting task. Once the fossil was cleaned up, this pliosaur\u2019s unique life story started to make sense.\u201d\nTentatively identified as female, the pliosaur lived to a ripe old, as evidenced by its large size and fused skull bones, Sassoon and her colleagues determined. But the carnivore seems to have spent its golden years grappling with progressive arthrosis, a degenerative disease of the joints. \u201cThere is evidence of erosion in the jaw joints, probably the result of wear and tear on the cartilage,\u201d Sassoon explained. \u201cThe disease led to a misalignment of jaws, the lower jaw being deviated to one side. This is clearly indicated by tooth marks from the upper jaw impinging on the bone of the lower jaw and, similarly, a tooth from the lower jaw causing an infection in the tooth socket of the upper jaw.\u201d\nStrictly speaking, pliosaurs weren\u2019t dinosaurs, but the predators shared certain characteristics with their contemporaries back on shore. \u201cReptiles are a group of related animals, so diseases in one branch of the reptile family could easily reflect diseases in another,\u201d said Sassoon. \u201cIt is highly probable that Mesozoic reptiles\u2014dinosaurs, crocodiles, marine reptiles, et cetera\u2014were susceptible to many diseases that we know very little about, since disease symptoms are so rarely preserved in the fossil record.\u201d\nSassoon pointed out that dinosaurs and giant marine reptiles, just like humans today, occupied the upper levels of their respective food chains. Free from predators, individuals could thus grow old enough to develop conditions like arthritis. \u201cThis work does suggest that as individual top-predator reptiles aged they, like humans, suffered from age-associated diseases,\u201d Sassoon said. \u201cWhen the disease developed too far, preventing an individual animal from feeding, it would lead to its demise.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Arthritisaurus: Did Elderly Dinos Get Inflamed Joints?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/pliosaur-skull.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/arthritisaurus-did-elderly-dinos-get-inflamed-joints"}
