So here are some facts to dispel those myths. \nMyth 1 \u2013 There is a debate about whether global warming is happening. \nWell it is happening, there are no, repeat NO, scientific reports which have ever said that global warming isn\u2019t happening. Scientists are not fighting over whether global warming is occurring, they all agree \u2013 all of them. Even the little petulant ones. The only people who think that there is a debate going on are the people who have been hoodwinked by the propaganda released by the big Oil Industries. Remember \u2013 business people lie \u2013 just think of the Marlboro Man.\nMyth 2 \u2013 Global warming is the same as Ozone Depletion. \nLook \u2013 they\u2019re two completely different phrases, and one has a \u2018Z\u2019 in it. They can\u2019t be the same. If they were, wouldn\u2019t we use the \u2018Z\u2019 one more? It\u2019s 10 points on the scrabble board!\nGlobal warming has to do with the increase in carbon dioxide (that\u2019s what we breath out) in the atmosphere. That stops radiation (sun light) from leaving the earth \u2013 ergo the earth heats up.\nOzone depletion is the reduction in Ozone (O3) \u2013 Ozone stops the bad radiation, UV, from getting to the surface of the Earth. The only thing this UV radiation does is cause burns and skin cancer!\nMyth 3 \u2013 Global warming is natural, humans have not had an effect. \nIt is true that the Earth regularly goes through periods of warming and cooling, these lead into and out of ice ages. But, humans have seriously influenced the climate. They have increased this natural warming to a level where we can experience it in our lifetimes \u2013 this shouldn\u2019t be happening. So stop using your car.\nMyth 4 - Global warming has doomed the polar bears.\nFor some reason, Al Gore\u2019s computerized polar bear can\u2019t swim, unlike the real kind, as one might expect of an animal named Ursa Maritimus. On the whole, these bears are thriving, mainly due to the reduction in hunting. As usual in this context, you must answer the question: Who are you going to believe \u2013 me or your lying eyes?\n\nMyth 5 \u2013 Global warming means it\u2019ll be hot, hot, hot!\nUnfortunately with the increase in CO2 in our atmosphere, it could be a case of global cooling, rather than warming, so don\u2019t go buying that vineyard in Devon just yet. An increase in CO2 will prevent radiation from even getting to the surface of the earth, so rather than warming us up, we\u2019ll begin cooling down.\nSo, now that you are all clued up on global warming, could someone nip round to David Belamy\u2019s house and let him know. He\u2019s still not too sure about any of it.\nIf you find this information useful and would like to get daily updates, feel free to subscribe to our RSS feed.","author":"emma","web_category":"science","title":"5 Global Warming Myths","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/Global-Warming-effectsjpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/offbeat-news/5-global-warming-myths/356"}
