All these new pieces of evidence offer a glimpse of what life and the natural environment was like 150 million years ago.\nThe long-necked, long-tailed plant-munching Sauropods were the largest animals that ever lived on land. The smallest were around 6m long, yet the largest could weight anything up to 110 tons. They\u2019re classed and subdivided into many species, by size and weight.\nAccording to the paleontologists at Burpee Museum of National History in Rockford who performed the excavations, the fossils have been extremely well preserved. Notwithstanding this, they say more time is needed to reveal the full importance of the site.Sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
