This however, does not account for the significant drop off in loggerheads this year. The only plausible explanation at the moment is that the loggerheads are falling victim to shrimp boats, which possibly catch them as they feed on the hard-shelled delights; a delicacy that other turtles don't enjoy. The unfortunate part is\u2026 \nShrimp boats have devices called \"turtle excluders\" on their nets, but may have already generated this population bottleneck in the past:  loggerheads take 30 years to reproduce a generation, so the impact of the excluders is far from a forgone conclusion.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
