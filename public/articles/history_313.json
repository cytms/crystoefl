The Prado Museum has owned the portrait for years but assumed it was a mediocre 16th- or 17th-century copy of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s original, which dates back to the early 1500s. That\u2019s because the replica\u2019s subject\u2014though bearing an unmistakable resemblance to \u201cLa Gioconda,\u201d as da Vinci called her\u2014appeared in front of a plain black backdrop rather than the Tuscan countryside of the Louvre\u2019s version.\nBut two years ago, restorers working on the copy discovered that the dark layers of paint surrounding Mona Lisa concealed a landscape nearly identical to the original\u2019s background. Infrared tests yielded an even bigger surprise: Sketch marks known as underdrawings mirrored those on da Vinci\u2019s canvas, suggesting that the painter of the replica had worked alongside the Renaissance master.\nAmong the many apprentices da Vinci took under his wing throughout his career, he had particularly close relationships with aspiring artists Francesco Melzi and Andrea Salai; the latter even inherited the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d after his mentor\u2019s death. Experts have named both men as potential painters of the Prado copy, the Art Newspaper reported. Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, a wealthy silk merchant\u2019s wife from Florence, is thought to have sat for da Vinci\u2019s most celebrated work\u2014and maybe, it now appears, a facsimile by one of his disciples.\nWhile layers of cracked, wrinkled varnish obscure the beauty of the original \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Prado version has emerged remarkably unblemished from its ongoing restoration. Experts think the copy\u2019s well-preserved details might even reveal new information about da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece, helping us see what the painting looked like before age and exposure took their toll. The replica will go on display at the Prado later this month before traveling to France for a da Vinci exhibit.\nDoes the real Mona Lisa, frozen behind glass at the Louvre, resent the airbrushed radiance of her newly discovered doppelganger? Whatever the answer, she\u2019s sure to keep faking her legendary half-smile.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Mona Lisa\u2019s Long-Lost Twin Turns Up in Spain","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mona-lisa-comparison.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/mona-lisas-long-lost-twin-turns-up-in-spain"}
