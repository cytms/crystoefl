It remains unclear exactly why.\n?\nResearchers are examining the idea that a child's immune system has not been properly challenged in an environment that is too clean, also known as the hygiene hypothesis.\n?\nAccidentally eating food cooked in peanut oil or made with nuts or inhaling the lingering peanut dust around the ball park can trigger severe reactions in those who are allergic.\n?\nMinnesota Twins fans with nut allergies were invited to Monday's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n?\nAt Target Field in Minneapolis, 100 fans will watch the action from two balconies tucked in the left field corner that provide a stellar view, a separate entrance and peanut-free concessions, said marketing vice president Patrick Klinger.\n?\nKids with severe peanut and tree nut allergies, like Jenny Kales' 11-year-old daughter Alexandra, are unlikely to outgrow their sensitivity and are accustomed to traveling with hand wipes, medicine, their own snacks and an EpiPen used to counter an anaphylactic reaction. The Kales family attended the Cubs game last summer worry-free for Alexandra's first game.\n?\n\"When you take the food allergy out of the equation, it's a huge thing because it lets you have a regular experience,\" she said.\n?\nAt Boston's storied Fenway Park, the stadium sells some 1,000 bags of Cracker Jacks and 3,000 bags of peanuts during a single game, said Red Sox senior manager of public affairs Zineb Marchoudi.\n?\nBut the team also organized three games this season with a peanut allergy friendly section for 226 people and made available throughout the season a sanitized 10-person booth.\n?\nAway from big cities and major league clubs, families are finding a number of minor league teams with peanut-free accommodations.\n?\nThe Rochester Red Wings 12,000-seat stadium in upstate New York has a grassy beam on the third baseline that is a no-peanut zone for every game, said team President Naomi Silver.\n?\nThe stadium also offers allergen-free food at a concession stand dubbed FREE that offers munchies made without basic allergens like nuts, dairy, wheat and shellfish.\n?\n\"It may not be the most popular, but it is the most appreciated food stand in the stadium,\" said Silver.\n?\n(Editing by Barbara Goldberg and Jerry Norton)\n?\nCopyright 2011?
