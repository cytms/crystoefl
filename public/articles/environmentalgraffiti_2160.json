If memory of Latin class serves, that's medspeak for \"putting teeth into your head as fake eyes.\"\nThe procedure, which has been around since being invented by what I presume were some heavily intoxicated Italians in the 1960s, uses the tooth to create an artificial cornea.  In the case of Bob, his son, Robert, donated not just a tooth, which had a hole drilled into it to hold a lens, but also part of his jaw, which became part of the eye socket.  This of course took quite a bit of time and effort--fifteen hours over two operations, which had initially been given a 65% chance of success. Bob, however, has gained a good portion of his sight back.\nInfo From Physorg.com \nBy new Environmental Graffiti contributor Ben Ray.
