Completely bald apart from a little moustache, they\u2019re the ideal pet for an allergy infested consumer.\nUnsurprisingly they need regular moisturising, as their skin dries out quickly, and they require sunscreen in the summer to avoid burning. Luckily, they can be easily styled as they love a warm jumper in the winter months, but eat three times as much as their hairy counterpart in their attempt to keep warm. Regardless of these obvious difficulties, Skinny lovers are still willing to pay up to ¢G150 for these little darlings.\nDemand is currently outstripping supply, and traditional breeders are making a stand against an animal who needs sunscreen and a sweatshirt to survive. With an increase in designer pets, Toygers being the a firm favourite, where will it stop?
