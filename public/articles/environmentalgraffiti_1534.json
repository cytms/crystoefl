In fact, that only represents the most superficial level. Often enough, steampunk doesn\u2019t attempt to glorify the aesthetic of an alternate history, but attempts to criticize the effect of technology on civilization and the environment. It just so happens that the criticism wears an attractive and resonant fa?ade, which inspires others to extract a more pleasing purpose out of it.\nThe following books are ones that showcase steampunk\u2019s darker side when it comes to humanity\u2019s impact on the environment. \n\nPhoto: William M. Vander Weyde\n5. The Light Ages, by Ian MacLeod. \nOur protagonist grows up in an English factory town with the boom of the local engines reverberating in his head. Robert Barrows must unravel the long-term effects of refining \u201caether,\u201d the magical essence of the earth, for mechanical consumption. An intensely emotional, gut-wrenching read. \n\nPhoto: Fred Labitzke, Michael Moorcock\n4. A Nomad of the Time Streams,? by Michael Moorcock\nStumbling through time and space, Oswald Bastable encounters myriad versions of a world at war with itself. Scenes of airship warfare are particularly jarring and destructive on the worldwide landscape, solidifying the harmful byproduct of progress. The most inspiring aspect of these stories is none other than Bastable\u2019s transformation from a British imperialist to a freedom fighter bent on halting nuclear proliferation. \n\nPhoto: George A. Van Biesbroeck, Smithsonian Institute\n3. The Steampunk Trilogy, by Paul Di Filippo\nCompounded in the story \u201cVictoria\u201d is the notion that intelligence and invention don\u2019t solve the problems of the world \u2014 they create them. Morally bankrupt protagonist Cosmo Cowperthwait is a master of patching over his self-manufactured wrongdoings and maintaining the horrific status quo of 19th century London. When witnessing teams of homeless urchins dredging garbage and bodies from the River Thames, he remarks how a steam engine could get the work done with ten times the efficiency rather than suggest ways to prevent the pollution at its inception. A touching read, as hilarious as it is morally ambiguous. \nPhoto: David Frankland, Philip Reeve\n\n2. The Hungry City Chronicles, by Philip Reeve\nCities of the post-apocalypse have evolved into Traction Cities, mechanical behemoths plowing over the earth on giant treads, seeking to devour each other for spare parts. The Green Storm rebels are environmentalism at its most militant, making the world green again in the only way they know how: by destroying all Traction Cities. \n\nPhoto: Ann Monn, Ann &amp; Jeff VanderMeer\n1. \u201cThe Selene Gardening Society,\u201d by Molly Brown, from Ann and Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s Steampunk\nEnvironmentalism is tackled through humor and biting social criticism in this short story. J.T. Maston invents a cannon large enough to shoot all of the world\u2019s garbage at the Moon, composting on a cosmic scale to create a terraformed Edenic garden. That was how the plan started, in any case. J.T. previously wanted to blast the earth at a different angle to melt the polar ice caps and dig for coal underneath. The issue at hand seems consistently apparent: no matter how we try and solve our problems, in the end, we can only make a bigger gun to point at it.? \nThese only scratch the surface - there's a lot more to read. The genre has a real talent for counterbalancing the horrific with the beautiful, digging through the worst of humanity to find what's best at its core. Our relationship to the environment - and how it changes - often serves the best cipher for that exploration.
