At this early stage of maize\u2019s history, however, it didn\u2019t represent a major component of their diet. This would change by the 12th century, when maize cultivation became vital to the Inca Empire\u2019s rise and subsequent expansion across Peru.\nCorn was first domesticated from a wild grass in Mexico nearly 9,000 years ago, according to study co-author Dolores Piperno, a curator at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History. It then made its way across Central and South America, where hundreds of distinct maize types\u2014including the ancestors of sweet corn, which many people eat today\u2014arose. The cobs and other corn scraps found at Paredones and Huaca Prieta indicate a diversity of kernel shapes and colors, a sign that this process was already in full swing.\n\u201cOur results show that only a few thousand years [after its domestication] corn arrived in South America where its evolution into different varieties that are now common in the Andean region began,\u201d Piperno said. \u201cThis evidence further indicates that in many areas corn arrived before pots did and that early experimentation with corn as a food was not dependent on the presence of pottery.\u201d\nThe discovery described in the study suggests that popcorn came about 1,000 years earlier than previously thought. It also represents a rare example of early maize remains; since the humid tropics between Central and South America are not conducive to the grain\u2019s preservation, much of what we know about corn evolution comes from microscopic remnants. \u201cBecause there is so little data available from other places for this time period, the wealth of morphological information about the cobs and other corn remains at this early date is very important for understanding how corn became the crop we know today,\u201d Piperno explained.\nHow did popcorn\u2019s earliest addicts prepare the crunchy treat in a world without microwaves, stovetops or artificial butter? Since they didn\u2019t even have ceramic pots at their disposal back then, chances are they roasted the cobs directly over coals or flames. Later inhabitants of Peru\u2019s northern coast would perfect the technique by developing the world\u2019s oldest known popper\u2014a shallow vessel with a handle and a hole on top\u2014around 300 A.D. The first popcorn machine made its debut 1,500 years later at the 1893 Chicago World\u2019s Fair.","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"Popcorn Was Popular in Ancient Peru, Discovery Suggests","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ancient-popcorn.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/popcorn-was-popular-in-ancient-peru-discovery-suggests"}
