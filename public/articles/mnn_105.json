His death ray burned concrete, melted metal and baked mud.\n?\nGrant Thompson, the self-proclaimed King of Random, recently built his own solar death ray using a light-focusing Fresnel lens scavenged from an old rear-projection television. The Fresnel lens was used inside the TV to help focus the light beam that \"draws\" the image on the screen. Grant mounted the lens on a swivel and built a holding platform at its focal length. Voil? \u2014 instant solar death ray.\n?\nCheck out Grant's death ray in action in the videos below. The first one shows how he built it, the second just shows him burning stuff. Both are awesome.\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\nGrant has a lot of really great videos on his YouTube channel. Check out his episodes about how to make an emergency phone charger, how to start a fire using a water bottle, and how to make your own electrolysis water fuel converter.\n?\n[Via NPR & Aatish Bhatia/Twitter]\n?\n?\nAre you on Twitter??Follow me (@sheagunther) there, I give good tweets.?And if you really like my writing, you can join my Facebook page and visit my homepage.","author":"","web_category":"earth-matters#energy","title":"How to turn an old TV into a solar death ray","picture_url":"http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/solar-death-ray-feat.jpg","url":"http://www.mnn.com//earth-matters/energy/blogs/how-to-turn-an-old-tv-into-a-solar-death-ray"}
