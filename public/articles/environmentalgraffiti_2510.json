It is thus: First, a positive scientific discovery will be made. Then it will be blamed for causing cancer.\nI was inspired to that particular bit of genius by a new report in which doctors suggest that the more intense light from low-energy light bulbs can exacerbate skin problems and potentially cause cancer.\nSpectrum, a group of charities working with sufferers of light-sensitivity conditions issued the report with the British Association of Dermatologists. The report comes on the heels of a warning by the Migraine Action Association that said the bulbs\u2019 more intense light can trigger migraines.\nThe groups\u2019 complaint is with the government\u2019s plan to phase out traditional light bulbs by 2011. The plan so far will completely ban traditional bulbs, with no allowances made for those who suffer from sensitivity to light. According to Spectrum, almost 350,000 people could have their health affected by the ban. They want the government to allow medical exemptions to the incandescent bulb ban.\nDr Colin Holden of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: 'It is important that patients with photosensitive skin eruptions are allowed to use lights that don't exacerbate their condition. Photosensitive eruptions range from disabling eczema-like reactions, to light sensitivities that can lead to skin cancer. It is essential that such patients are able to protect themselves from specific wavelengths of light emitted by fluorescent bulbs, especially as they are often trapped indoors because they can't venture out in natural sunlight.'\nSpectrum is beginning a campaign to raise awareness of the energy saving bulbs\u2019 health effects, including the possibility they can lead to skin cancer. I\u2019m going to go ahead and guess their campaign probably won\u2019t involve a lot of outdoor advertising.\nThis story manages to perfectly combine two examples of modern day ridiculousness: cancer fear mongering and government idiocy. I can\u2019t decide which is sillier. I\u2019m thinking cancer fear mongering. It\u2019s gotten to the point where we\u2019re now concerned about light bulbs burning too brightly. Perhaps I should wear sunscreen when I venture from my bed.\nOf course, there really should be exemptions to the incandescent bulb ban for medical reasons. If a light bulb can actually do someone harm, they shouldn\u2019t have to use it. That being said, I don\u2019t see this actually being a problem once someone actually brings it to the government\u2019s attention. Maybe the new campaign will do just that.\nIf you want to find out all the latest interesting science news, why not subcribe to our RSS feed, we'll even throw in a free album.","author":"Chris","web_category":"lifestyle","title":"Low Energy Bulbs Can Cause Cancer, Along With Everything Else Ever Made.","picture_url":"http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/promoted/images/7-foods_veggies.jpg","url":"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/sciencetech/light-bulbs-blamed-for-cancer/668"}
