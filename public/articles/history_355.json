Traditionally, the credit goes to the American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who in 1929 reported that other galaxies appeared to be speeding away from us. He also described a correlation between their distances from Earth and the velocities at which they were moving, which is determined by a cosmic expansion rate now known as the Hubble constant (H). Hubble, who died in 1953, never received a Nobel Prize for one of history\u2019s most significant astronomical discoveries, but he remains a legend in his field and in 1983 was honored with a namesake telescope.\nBut Hubble wasn\u2019t the first person to show that faraway galaxies recede faster than close ones. Two years earlier, the Belgian priest, astronomer and physicist Georges Lema?tre published similar findings in an obscure French-language journal. He even proposed an expansion rate nearly identical to Hubble\u2019s original constant. In fact, many experts agree that Hubble simply confirmed the laws tentatively proposed by Lema?tre and presented them to a wider audience. So why do we use H rather than L to express how quickly the universe is growing? In short, when an English publication finally reprinted Lema?tre\u2019s paper in March 1931, key sections were lost in translation.\nAstronomers have known about the omitted paragraphs for several decades, and some have wondered why the vital content was cut\u2014and who exactly quashed it. \u201cIt\u2019s always been sort of a whodunit,\u201d said Ray Villard, news director at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates the Hubble Space Telescope. Earlier this year, the astronomer Sidney van den Bergh reignited the debate by suggesting that the translator of Lema?tre\u2019s paper deliberately skipped over passages about the velocity-distance relationship as well as the Belgian scientist\u2019s expansion rate calculation. The mathematician David Block then took the theory a step further, speculating that Hubble himself, being \u201cfiercely territorial,\u201d used his influence to censor details that might have compromised his claim to a landmark discovery.\nWriting in the November 10 issue of Nature, astrophysicist Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute attempts to put such conjectures to rest. As an astronomer who regularly works with the Hubble Space Telescope, he became interested in the controversy and its implications for Hubble\u2019s legacy. \u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that Lema?tre deserves the credit for proposing an expanding Universe,\u201d Livio explains in the Nature piece. \u201cBut the censorship charges tarnish Hubble\u2019s genuine achievement of confirming and extending the idea.\u201d\nTo clear Hubble\u2019s name, Livio sifted through hundreds of pieces of correspondence and the 1931 minutes of the Royal Astronomical Society Council, which printed the English version of Lema?tre\u2019s paper in its monthly notice. He dug up a letter that Lema?tre attached to the translation and addressed to the publication\u2019s editor, Willian Marshall Smart. In it, Lema?tre states that he translated his paper himself and assume responsibility for excising the missing paragraphs.\n\u201cI did not find advisable to reprint the provisional discussion of radial velocities which is clearly of no actual interest, and also the geometrical note, which could be replaced by a small bibliography of ancient and new papers on the subject,\u201d Lema?tre wrote in the note to Smart. \u201cI join a french text with indication of the passages omitted in the translation. I made this translation as exact as I can, but I would be very glad if some of yours would be kind enough to read it and correct my english which I am afraid is rather rough.\u201d\nIn Livio\u2019s view, the letter \u201cclearly ends speculation about who translated the paper and who deleted the paragraphs \u2014 Georges Lema?tre did both himself.\u201d Livio goes on to say that Lema?tre didn\u2019t bother reiterating his conclusions from 1927 precisely because his American peer had reached and popularized them more recently. \u201cLema?tre was not at all obsessed with establishing priority for his original discovery,\u201d Livio writes. He focused instead on furthering his own research, introducing his \u201chypothesis of the primeval atom\u201d\u2014now known as the Big Bang theory\u2014later in 1931.\nLivio adds that Lema?tre\u2019s willingness to duck the spotlight exemplifies the \u201cscientific psychology of (some of) the scientists of the 1920s.\u201d That mindset has since gone out of style among many of his successors, according to Villard. \u201cThe big thing today is who saw it first,\u201d he said. \u201cLema?tre didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. He was a humble guy.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Was Expanding Universe Discoverer Too Humble for Hubble?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/hubble-lemaitre-large.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/was-expanding-universe-discoverer-too-humble-for-hubble"}
