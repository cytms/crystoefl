The hot new thing in \u201cgreen\u201d alcohol retailing at the moment is \"lightweight\u201d glass bottles. \nNew technology means that less glass is needed to create a bottle of suitable strength. A bottle created using the latest technology uses over 30% less glass than a traditionally created bottle. While that doesn\u2019t translate to huge amounts of glass for each individual bottle, the cumulative effect is huge.\nIn the UK alone, over 1 billion bottles are used each year just for wine. Not only does using lightweight bottles save tons of glass, it can also save a lot of energy as it takes less energy to manufacture and ship the bottles.\nTesco, one of the UK\u2019s largest retailers, will sell 40 million lightweight bottles of wine this year. They aim to sell 25% of their wine in lightweight bottles within 2 years, a move they estimate will save almost 75,000 tons of glass.\nIt\u2019s not just winemakers who are introducing the lighter bottles either. Major breweries are on board the bandwagon. Scottish and Newcastle, which owns Fosters, Kronenbourg, and several others, as well as SABMiller, which owns Pilsner Urquell and a variety of other brands, are both introducing lighter bottles.\nThe changes are part of the GlassRite campaign, organized by the Waste and Resources Action Program (WRAP). The group attempts to make consumers and businesses more aware of the materials they use in products.\nI would also be remiss in my duties as an environmental writer if I didn't point out that all bottles of booze, lightweight or not, should be recycled.
