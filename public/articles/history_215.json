In this respect, it\u2019s as close to the original as it gets. Intended as a fundraising item, the edition was printed by a pair of entrepreneurs, Charles Leland and George Boker. In 1864 they hit upon the idea to produce 48 copies of the Emancipation Proclamation to be autographed by the president and sold at the Philadelphia Great Central Sanitary Fair in June of that year.\nLincoln had previously donated an autographed item to benefit the fair\u2019s organizer, the United States Sanitary Commission (USSC), a private agency that held events around the country to raise money for Union soldiers. This mission was dear to Lincoln\u2019s heart, and he once stated that the money it raised served to \u201crelieve and comfort our brave soldiers.\u201d The USSC improved conditions in military camps by funding the hiring of nurses and providing goods like medication and stationery. Louisa May Alcott, author of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d served as a sanitary commission nurse.\nLeland and Boker had corresponded with Lincoln\u2019s private secretary, John Nicolay, about the concept of releasing an authorized version of the Emancipation Proclamation. Both fervent abolitionists, the men showed their support for emancipation with anti-slavery writings and stage plays. Their new idea was to celebrate the issuance of the executive order by producing a deluxe edition of it, to be signed\u2014just like the original\u2014by Lincoln and Seward. Proceeds from the sale of each copy, priced at $10, would benefit the USSC. Under those conditions, Lincoln agreed to participate and put his hand to the entire print run.\nUnlike the official executive order, the Authorized Edition of the Emancipation Proclamation bears not only Lincoln\u2019s and Seward\u2019s signatures, but Nicolay\u2019s as well. Seth Kaller, a historical documents expert who represents the anonymous seller of the item to be auctioned, offered an explanation for this seemingly odd detail. \u201cThe first question, when somebody sees it now and somebody sees it back then is, \u2018Is it really signed by Lincoln?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHaving Nicolay sign was a good way to answer this question and authenticate the signatures. Also, I think, they really did want to make it clear this wasn\u2019t the original document, because Lincoln and Seward were the two signatories on the original.\u201d\nOf the 48 copies printed by Leland and Boker, not all were sold during the Philadelphia fair. A few were donated to libraries, and others were sold elsewhere. Today, only 26 copies are known to exist, which makes the item extremely valuable. Along with the Authorized Edition, Lincoln also signed two or three copies of a version created by a young man in California. \u201cThis boy had done a very decorative printing, with a flag and flowers, but it omitted all the constitutionally important text,\u201d Kaller said. \u201cThis was a case of somebody approaching Lincoln with a souvenir to sign.\u201d\nOther historically important copies of the Emancipation Proclamation include a miniature version given to Union soldiers, who distributed them throughout the South as the Army advanced, and printings of the text in Harper\u2019s Weekly and the New York Times. These items were produced in large quantities and regularly come up for auction. Many of them reside in private hands, but some can be found in museums.","author":"Elizabeth  Hanes","web_category":"news","title":"Emancipation Proclamation Copy Signed by Lincoln for Sale","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/emancipation-proclamation-auction.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/emancipation-proclamation-copy-signed-by-lincoln-for-sale"}
