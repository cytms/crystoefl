Strange shapes and creatures suddenly emerge in twilight, captured only by those skilful enough to make their fading outlines and mischief come to light. Here\u2019s skatepark fun as you\u2019ve never seen it before.\nAn earlier stage of the first image with surreal looking surroundings:Photo: \nPhotographer Ben Matthews is a UK-based dentist by day and a light artist by night who frequently seems to have alien encounters at his local skatepark. Over the years, he\u2019s become very skilled at capturing them on film as aliens are shy creatures. For the very first image, for example, he had to use a 12 ? minute exposure. His images are not retouched but various ones may be pasted together. He explains the first image: \u201cIt's actually a composite of images, which gives me a bit more flexibility in terms of taking time to get portions of it right.\u201d\nNo aliens yet but a strange creature at twilight:Photo: \nAh, the angel has landed:Photo: \nFleeing from the light monster:Photo: \nSays Ben about how he took the picture: \u201cIt is a long exposure of 70 seconds, but with one burst of flash as the curtain closes - the remote flash is visible beneath me.\u201d\nThe alien\u2019s first victim:Photo: \nThey\u2019re going wild!Photo: \nSays Ben about this one:\n\n\nLight spiders invading. Or are they octopi?Photo: \nHere, they simply turned into stripes:Photo: \nA vinyl disk? A UFO? A giant jug? We love it:Photo: \nAnd after the skatepark? The aliens moved on to the playground:Photo: \nFor those who are curious about how to do light paintings, Ben has filmed himself during one of his projects, er, encounters. Here\u2019s the link.\nAll the images are best viewed large, so make sure to visit Ben Matthews\u2019 Flickr photostream \u2013 you\u2019ll discover a new detail in every picture. We love it and hope that Ben will soon be able to spend less time on teeth and even more on photography.\nWith special thanks to Ben Matthews for making his photographs available!\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
