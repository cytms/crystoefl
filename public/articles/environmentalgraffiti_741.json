Most of the time these pictures elicit many an \"oooh\" and an \"awww\", and exclamations of cuteness. But what about the animals and how they're feeling when we decide to invade their space and point flashbulbs in their faces? Well, it seems that sometimes our furry friends really don't appreciate our paparazzi ways and fight back by refusing to sit pretty. The thing is, it doesn't stop, but encourages us, and somehow the snapshots still end up cute as ever.\nTake a look at these 12 images and tell us what you think!\n1. Sizing us up\nPhoto: Image: randeeryan\nThis little guy's got an attitude alright! That frown of disapproval and that slit of a right eye makes him look like a crotchety old pirate.\n2. In your facePhoto: Image: derpunk\nHe definitely doesn't mind getting up close and personal with the photographer. He's saying, \"You want a piece of me?\"\n3. Catch me if you canPhoto: Image: loungerie\nIt's almost looks like this fish didn't bother to wipe its mouth after having a glass of milk. It's not shy about it's brown teeth either.\n4.

Martial arts master\nPhoto: Image: Evolutionssackgasse\nIf the last monkey was sleepy, this ape's super-alert. He's striking a commanding pose to let us know that if we come any closer, he's going to unleash some mad kung fu skills on us.\n7. Tongue out\nPhoto: Image: left-hand\nRather than roaring, this lion decides to stick it's tongue out to taunt the photographer instead.\n8. Making facesPhoto: Image: rofanator\nThis giraffe really can't take the photographer seriously at all.\n9. Got nuts?Photo: Image: picvi\nThis squirrel would really love to get a good look inside the window to see if there's any food around. Who cares about pictures; he wants food!\n10.

The big, wet kissPhoto: Image: picvi\nTongue out and face pressed against the window, this dog refuses to just \"sit\", opting for an epic make-out session with the camera instead.\n12. All gums\nPhoto: Image: left-hand\nIt's not really donkey's a smile, but rather a grimace, maybe even a mean grimace: \"Get lost or I'll give you a swift kick in the you know where!\"\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
