There have been a number of other versions floating about over the past few years but none that have caught our attention quite as much as this mechanical offering.\nFesto explain how the technological wonder, called Aquajelly, works:\n\n\nThe ultimate idea is to have a number of the robots autonomously working together via a short-range radio and LED system so that the group of Aquajellys imitate real life. Fascinating stuff.\nCheck out Festo\u2019s website for more wicked wonders of the robotic world.\nSource 1, 2\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
