Almost escaping our fleeting glance, something catches our eye last-minute, something that seems off \u2013 a shape or material that doesn\u2019t seem to go with the image. By changing the context in which we see everyday objects, Kevin van Aelst makes us question their purpose and our understanding of the world around us.     \nA drop is a drop is a drop? \u2013 \u201cSplash\u201d (2009):Photo: \nMade of carpet? - A view of the whole installation:Photo: \nOr, in Van Aelst\u2019s own words:\nWhen describing Van Aelst\u2019s photography, the toughest part might be the selection process, deciding which of his images to feature. This is because all of them are unique and incredibly creative, making viewers want to discover the how and what for themselves, all of it. Like his ingenious \u201cOreo Yin Yang\u201d (2005), in perfect harmony with itself:\nOr take Van Aelst\u2019s fingerprint series for example. These are thumb or index finger impressions created with or on unusual material: pie, yarn, paper and mustard are just some examples.\nSpinning some yarn \u2013 \u201cLeft Index Finger\u201d (2007):Photo: \nIsn\u2019t using a typewriter like leaving a fingerprint? \u2013 \u201cRight Thumb\u201d (2007):Photo: \nHe mustard up all his courage - \u201cLeft Ring Finger\u201d (2007):Photo: \nShowing someone the finger has never been so creative - \u201cLeft Middle Finger\u201d (2007):Photo: \nTalking about his own talent, Van Aelst once revealed to his students: \u201cPatience and obsession can be more of a factor for success [than talent]. For example, I can\u2019t draw or sculpt but I can put things together and photograph them.\u201d And that he does really well, or who else would be able to explain the different kinds of clouds with a cup of coffee? \nStorm in a, er, coffee mug \u2013 \u201cCommon Clouds\u201d (2007):Photo: \nCould you explain \u201cChromosomes\u201d (2005) in such a sweet way?Photo: \nOr the \u201cPeriodic Table of the Elements\u201d (2005), recreated with Gummi bears?Photo: \n\u201cBeta-Carotene Molecule\u201d (2006) for your next jack-o lantern? Photo: \nLuckily for the art world and his growing number of fans, Kevin Van Aelst did not pursue a career as a psychologist after receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in Psychology from Cornell University in 2002. He switched to Fine Arts instead and received his MFA from the University of Hartford, Connecticut in 2005. He currently lives and works in New Haven, CT where he teaches and pursues his art. If his pieces look familiar, you might have seen them in publications like the New York Times Magazine, Men\u2019s Health, GQ, Business Week, Fast Company and others.\nThe artist\u2019s \u201cSlurpee Self\u201d:Photo: \nOh, and those who\u2019ve always wanted to own art works can do so now with Van Aelst\u2019s pieces: As part of an Artspace fundraiser, he made a portable art show of 28 of his works, complete with magnifying glass, price list and refreshments table. Guaranteed recession-sized.
