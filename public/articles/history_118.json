In 1934, he announced his intention to make a full-length animated feature film of the Snow White story, and estimated the cost would be around $250,000. Instead, production lasted three years and took around 750 artists, and nearly 2 million individual paintings, to complete. In that process, Disney acted mostly as head coordinator and decision-maker rather than as a designer and artist. As costs ballooned to nearly $1.5 million\u2013an enormous sum for a film budget in 1937\u2013he was forced to borrow money to complete the movie, even taking out a mortgage on his home. The Hollywood press called the project \u201cDisney\u2019s Folly,\u201d and his own wife, Lillian, predicted it would be a box office failure. It was assumed that audiences couldn\u2019t stomach a full-length cartoon, and that adults wouldn\u2019t pay to sit through a fairy tale.\nOn December 21, 1937, however, \u201cSnow White\u201d silenced these cynics when it premiered to a packed house at the Carthay Circle Theatre. Stars such as Shirley Temple, Clark Gable, Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland and Cary Grant attended the Hollywood premiere, while more than 30,000 fans unable to score a $5 ticket gathered outside the theater to share in the night\u2019s excitement. Charlie Chaplin told the Los Angeles Times after the premiere that the film \u201ceven surpassed our highest expectations. In Dwarf Dopey, Disney has created one of the greatest comedians of all time.\u201d\n\u201cSnow White\u201d went on to become a massive hit worldwide, grossing more than any other movie in history up to that time. (\u201cGone With the Wind\u201d would surpass it in 1939.) At the time of its 50th anniversary in 1987, the New York Times reported that \u201cSnow White\u201d had grossed some $330 million worldwide, and remained one of the most popular films ever made. It was also the first American film to have a soundtrack album released simultaneously with the film\u2019s release, featuring such famous songs as \u201cHeigh-Ho,\u201d \u201cWhistle While You Work\u201d and \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come.\u201d\nIn addition to its commercial success, the movie received a special Academy Award, including one full-size Oscar and seven dwarf-sized statuettes. Its sophisticated artistic composition notably influenced such directors as Federico Fellini and Orson Welles, whose opening shot in 1941\u2032s \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d (a castle at night with one illuminated window) is nearly identical to the first shot of \u201cSnow White.\u201d\nThe stunning success of \u201cSnow White\u201d marked a turning point in the career of Walt Disney, and established him among the world\u2019s most celebrated filmmakers. The quality of its animation, voiceover work and musical score set a high standard for all future animated features made by Disney or any other studio. Along with \u201cPinocchio\u201d (1940), it is widely considered to be Disney\u2019s greatest film.","author":"Sarah  Pruitt","web_category":"news","title":"Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HITH-Snow-Wihite.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/celebrating-the-75th-anniversary-of-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs"}
