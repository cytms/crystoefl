Normally conservationists will focus on one species, and then begin to work on another.  But Madagascar presented such a unique set of circumstances: a large area, incredible diversity,  imminent threats-- that the \"one-taxon approach\" was deemed no longer viable.\nEnvironmental Graffiti is up for four bloggers\u2019 choice awards.
