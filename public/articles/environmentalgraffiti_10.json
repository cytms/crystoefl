{"summary":"Sizing Up the Atlas Moth. The larger female Atlas moth is pinned in the upper part of this image","advice_category":"2","content":"\nPhoto: internets_dairy\nThe Atlas moth, Attacus atlas, ranks as the world's largest moth when measured according to the surface area covered by its wings.\nAs you can see here, it's about the size of a hand. That's about 400 square centimeters.\nSizing Up the Atlas Moth\nMeasuring \u2018only\u2019 25 to 30 centimeters from the tip of one wing to the other, the Atlas moth is not the largest creature of its kind in terms of wingspan (that honor belongs to the white witch moth, which has a wingspan of 28 cm). It also has a relatively small body. Still, it's enough to make a tasty meal for its predators.\nPhoto: internets_dairy\nLarge even its larval stage, the Atlas caterpillar grows up to about 11 centimeters in length.\nGender Differences among the Atlas Moths\nPhoto: woodleywonderworks\nThe female is larger than the male. The larger female Atlas moth is pinned in the upper part of this image. \nPhoto: Nyctalimon\nThe male Atlas moth compensates for this lack of size with his magnificent feathered antennae. These are sensitive to the female's pheromones. After looking at this close-up of a male Atlas, you can compare it with the unadorned antennae of the larger female in the previous picture.\nPhoto: Ryan Somma \nThe Pacific Science Centre presented the Attacus atlas with an award for its wing area \u2013 so it\u2019s widely recognized for its size!\nLife Span of the Attacus atlas Moth\nThe Atlas moth begins its life as an egg attached to the underside of a leaf. The caterpillars hatch after one to two weeks. Their task is to eat leaves from a variety of plants: for example cinnamon, citrus fruit, guava and Jamaican cherry trees.\nPhoto: Deanster1983 (Dean Morley)\nIt's hard to tell whether this Attacus atlas caterpillar is coming or going!\nPhoto: Deanster1983 (Dean Morley)\nNow it's clear that it\u2019s crawling from left to right. The face of the Atlas moth caterpillar does not have orange-red lips!\nPhoto: Deanster1983 (Dean Morley)\nAfter eating its fill, an Atlas caterpillar spins a cocoon. There it will pupate for about one month.\nPhoto: slappytheseal\nAttacus atlas only lives about two weeks as an adult moth. Adults do not have fully developed mouth parts, so they cannot eat. During adulthood, of course they must avoid predators, mate, and lay eggs to ensure that there will be a next generation of Atlas moths.\nWhere does the Atlas Moth Live?\nThe Atlas moth is a native of southern China, India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Its habitat includes tropical and sub-tropical forests. \nPhoto: internets_dairy\nIn India, the silk of the Atlas pupa's cocoon is made into \u2018Fagara' silk even though the strands are broken. (This is different from the thread from silkworm cocoons, which is unbroken.) Despite the breaks, Fagara silk is quite serviceable.\nSome Taiwanese also use one whole Attacus atlas cocoon as a small purse!\nThe World's Biggest Moth has Deceptive Wings\nAlthough Attacus atlas is truly a giant moth, it also has beautiful colors and a deceptive pattern on its colorful wings.\nPhoto: john_amend_all2000\nThe wingtips are thought by some to resemble the heads of snakes! The eyes seem to gaze away from the Atlas moth's body, and the snakes' necks show scaly patterns.\nReferences:Ria Tan, Naturia, \"Atlas Moth Attacus atlas\", 2001, referenced Aug. 22, 2012.
