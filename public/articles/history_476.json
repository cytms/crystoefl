After eating the sausage, the emperor is said to have declared, \u201cI have discovered something of great importance.\u201d If your favorite ballpark treat is a fresh hot dog overflowing with ketchup, mustard and sauerkraut, you just might concur.\nIn the 15th century, the city of Frankfurt spawned the \u201cfrankfurter,\u201d a spiced and smoked sausage with a slightly curved shape. The \u201cwiener,\u201d a sausage made of pork and beef, originated in Vienna, known in German as Wien, in 1805. Throughout the 19th century, the snack that would soon become the hot dog gained a following America, thanks to immigrants from Europe.\nSo what distinguishes a hot dog from a frankfurter or wiener? That\u2019s where the bun comes in\u2014and its exact origins are up for debate. Many hot dog historians credit Antonoine Feuchtwanger, a St. Louis peddler who offered his customers white gloves along with their piping hot sausages to keep them from burning their hands. The problem was that many people walked off with the gloves rather than returning them, and Feuchtwanger\u2019s profits suffered. Around 1883, the cash-strapped concessionaire\u2019s wife came up with an ingenious solution: long, soft rolls that perfectly fit the sausages. Feuchtwanger dubbed the meat-bread combo \u201cred hots.\u201d\nOthers point to Charles Feltman, a German butcher who in 1867 began selling hot sausages on rolls out of the pie wagon he hauled up and down the sand dunes of Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island. Within a few years, he expanded his business from one lowly pushcart into a hot dog empire with an immense restaurant, a beer garden and multiple stands. Business was booming until Nathan Handwerker, a bread slicer at Feltman\u2019s, broke away to open his own stand in 1916. He undercut his former boss, charging half the price per dog: five cents instead of 10. Today, Nathan\u2019s Famous hot dogs are sold in more than 20,000 food service and retail outlets across the United States. Since 1916, the original Coney Island location has held an annual hot dog eating contest on July 4; the current record stands at 68 dogs in 10 minutes.\nDid You Know?\nPeanuts\nRaw or roasted, shelled or unshelled, peanuts have been a classic ballpark snack since the earliest days of baseball, but their history goes back much further. Spanish conquistadors exploring the New World were first introduced to peanuts in South America, most likely in Brazil and Peru. They took the plant back home to Europe, and it quickly spread to Africa and Asia. In the 1700s, slave traders brought the peanut back across the Atlantic, using it as a cheap food source for African captives.\nA handful of commercial farms in the southern United States started growing peanuts in the 1800s, mainly for oil and livestock fodder; as a food, it was regarded as something only poor people ate. That all changed during the Civil War, when soldiers on both sides recognized the peanut\u2019s value as a tasty, convenient and inexpensive snack. After the war, demand increased rapidly as vendors began selling freshly roasted peanuts on street corners, at circuses and, of course, at baseball games.\nIn the early 1900s, George Washington Carver, a renowned botanist who was the son of a slave, began researching peanuts, hoping to find an alternative cash crop that could lessen the South\u2019s dependence on cotton. His work led to widespread peanut cultivation across the country, especially in the South, and earned him a reputation as the father of the American peanut industry.\nDid You Know?\nCracker Jack\nNative Americans first started popping corn thousands of years ago. By 1893, popcorn makers Frederick and Louis Rueckheim were determined to give the puffed kernels a new twist. The two brothers threw molasses and peanuts into the mix, and unveiled the sweet and salty treat at the 1893 World\u2019s Fair in Chicago. A few years later, they developed a special formula to keep the ingredients from sticking together that remains a secret to this day. A satisfied taster pronounced the new and improved snack \u201ccrackerjack,\u201d using a slang term of the era that roughly translates to \u201cawesome.\u201d The Rueckheims trademarked the expression, and a decade later Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer immortalized it in the classic song \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame.\u201d Amazingly, it would be years before the two songwriters saw an actual game of baseball.\nDid You Know?","author":"History.com  Staff","web_category":"news","title":"The History of Ballpark Food","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ballpark-eats-thumb_large_310x206.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/the-history-of-ballpark-food"}
