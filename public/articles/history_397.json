Until 500 years ago, the popular libation could only ferment in warm environments, where Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u2014the yeast used to make ale, bread and wine\u2014likes to grow. In the 15th century, however, Bavarian brewers started producing a new, less cloudy type of beer known as lager, which fermented over longer periods of time in chilly caves and basements.\nIn recent decades, researchers have discovered that the yeast responsible for lager\u2014now the most widely consumed beer in the world\u2014is a hybrid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a distant relative that thrives in the cold. But how exactly this mysterious yeast arrived in Bavaria to mate with its cousin, ultimately ending the primacy of ale in the beer landscape, remained a mystery.\n\u201cScientists have known it must have come from somewhere but couldn\u2019t find it in nature in Europe,\u201d explained Chris Todd Hittinger, a genetics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nHittinger and other members of an international team think they\u2019ve finally pinpointed the wild yeast that paved the way for today\u2019s $250-billion-a-year lager industry. Dubbed Saccharomyces eubayanus, it turned up in an unlikely corner of the world: Patagonia, an alpine region at the tip of South America that lies more than 7,000 miles away from the Bavarian caves where it met its match.\nDiego Libkind of the Institute for Biodiversity and Environment Research in Bariloche, Argentina, discovered the elusive species in irregular growths on infected beech trees. Rich in simple sugars, these blister-like \u201cgalls\u201d provide a perfect habitat for yeast, which gobbles up carbohydrates and converts them into alcohol.\nResearchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine sequenced the newfound species\u2019 genome and compared it to that of lager yeast. \u201cWe could see that it was a 99.5-percent match to the non-ale portion of the hybrid yeast but that it didn\u2019t match any other pure strain from the wild,\u201d Hittinger said. These findings positively identified Saccharomyces eubayanus as the species that fused with domesticated yeast back in medieval Bavaria, he added.\nSo how exactly did these intrepid microorganisms cross the ocean to colonize faraway Europe? \u201cThis is obviously speculation, but transatlantic trade would have provided a number of ways that yeast would have been more than happy to travel by,\u201d said Hittinger. He explained that the tiny stowaway could have hitched a ride in fruit, juice or alcoholic beverages; in the stomach of a fly; or even on a piece of wood.\nOnce introduced to its remote kin Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the two yeast species formed spores that mated to yield the lager-producing hybrid. Like mules, the crossbreed strain does not generate offspring, but it can divide asexually indefinitely, Hittinger said. And that\u2019s just what it\u2019s been doing for the last five centuries.\nBut that\u2019s not all lager yeast has been up to, according to the researchers\u2019 study, published August 22 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Over the years, the hybrid has undergone genetic mutations that allowed it to metabolize wort\u2014the sweet mixture of water and barley that serves as beer\u2019s starting point\u2014even more efficiently. \u201cOur discovery suggests that hybridization instantaneously formed an imperfect \u2018proto-lager\u2019 yeast that was more cold-tolerant than ale yeast and ideal for the cool Bavarian lagering process,\u201d Hittinger said. \u201cAfter adding some new variation for brewers to exploit, its sugar metabolism probably became more like ale yeast and better at producing beer.\u201d\nThanks to Saccharomyces eubayanus\u2019 epic journey, lager has now eclipsed ale as the preferred brew of many beer aficionados around the world. But even among the researchers who uncovered the species, opinions vary. Hittinger and fellow co-author Mark Johnson, for instance, have a longstanding friendly disagreement about the beverages\u2019 relative merits. \u201cHe\u2019s an ale man, and I\u2019m a lager man,\u201d Hittinger said, \u201cbut I think we both have a new appreciation for the complex history of lagers.\u201d","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Lager: Patagonian for Beer?","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/beech-galls.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/lager-patagonian-for-beer"}
