This post is about an American artist who gives us all pause for thought by taking what we discard so thoughtlessly and transforming it into something that can take your breath away for the innovative use of these materials. Photo: Nick+Georgiou Nick Georgiou is a Queens-born artist known for his use of the printed word as an artistic medium, but not in the way you think. He creates creatures and art pieces out of discarded newspapers and books, and has a penchant for depositing them in random locations throughout New York City. ?He creates anything from delightfully odd critters to eerily depictive portraits. Here are some of his most interesting works. Photo: Nick+Georgiou This Tucson, Arizona based artist\u2019s work is inspired by \u201cthe death of the printed word/world, economic collapse, political and environmental uncertainty.\" Georgiou states: \"Books and newspapers are becoming artifacts of the 21st century. Whatever we used to read off paper, we\u2019re now reading off digital screens. Our way of interacting with text is changing. My work is not only about the decline of the printed word in today\u2019s society but its rebirth as art.\u201d Photo: Nick+Georgiou Georgiou recently opened a new gallery/studio space in downtown Tucson.? He is also completing a documentary about the decline of the printed word  and is working on a series of sculptures for a solo exhibition in Cyprus and Greece. Dogs slinking down alleyways and rooting through trash aren\u2019t that uncommon in a big city, but dogs that are trash do present a different perspective. Photo: Nick+Georgiou When I imagine artwork made out of newspapers and books, I immediately assume it will take the form of some sort of collage utilizing interesting words or phrases. I never expected to see portraits of people and animals appearing to be spawned straight out of a discarded pile of books, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nPhoto: Nick+Georgiou\nNick Georgiou\u2019s tendency to place his art in random positions in the city makes stumbling upon them that more exciting. Where one is used to seeing garbage piled on the side of the street, it\u2019s an odd experience to see that garbage staring back at you with wild eyes. Georgiou\u2019s artworks can be found on street corners and next to lamp posts, but they\u2019re also available in exhibitions and peering through the glass windows of Georgiou\u2019s hometown. Seeing these newspaper creations outside feels right, since city dwellers are so used to seeing the occasional tumbleweed of a newspaper rolling down the street. Photo: Nick+Georgiou It\u2019s interesting, then, to see Georgiou\u2019s work fully framed and placed on a wall as if it were any normal painting or photograph. One doesn\u2019t expect to see torn out books adorning an office or bedroom, but the startling fact is that they grab your attention and hold it. This is the ultimate in re-purposing of trash, and Nick deserves all the praise we can heap upon him for the fantastic work he does. He gave me permission to use all the images in this story, obtained from his website.
