Several thousand years before prehistoric painters left their stamp on the famous cave, their neighbors to the west were decorating the limestone surfaces of their rock shelter with abstract symbols. These representations of female anatomy have been dated to 37,000 years ago, making them the earliest known wall art, anthropologists report in the most recent edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nKnown as Abri Castanet, the collapsed shelter in the Dordogne region was once home to a group of reindeer hunters who left behind thousands of artifacts. \u201cAbri Castanet has long been recognized as one of the oldest sites in Eurasia with evidence for human symbolism in the form of hundreds of personal ornaments,\u201d said New York University anthropology professor Randall White, one of the study\u2019s coauthors. Examples include pierced animal teeth, pierced shells and beads, he said.\nEngravings and paintings were first discovered at Abri Castanet before World War I, but archaeologists couldn\u2019t determine whether the decorated limestone blocks once formed part of the fallen rock shelter. A geological analysis now shows that the art adorned the ceiling of the natural structure, perched 6.5 feet above the ground, White said. Prehistoric artists would have reached up, chisels and ochre pigment in hand, to embellish their home.\nWith paintings up to 32,000 years old, Chauvet boasts a vivid menagerie of animals so deftly rendered that they defy our incorrect assumptions about cavemen\u2019s limited intellectual capacities. The older art at Abri Castanet, by contrast, consists of simple rings and abstract forms thought to represent female genitalia. \u201cThis art appears to be slightly older than the famous paintings from the Grotte Chauvet in southeast France but of a very different tradition,\u201d White explained. \u201cWhile there are animal figures, the dominant motif is considered to represent abstract female vulvas, although this interpretation has been contested and discussed for more than a century.\u201d\nUnlike the Chauvet paintings, located deep in uninhabited reaches of the cave, the Abri Castanet wall art festooned central living areas where people once ate and produced tools. \u201cThe engravings and paintings at Castanet are now shown to be directly associated with everyday life,\u201d said White. \u201cIn other words, the art at Castanet seems to be a quotidian art.\u201d\nWhite said that the dating of the Abri Castanet wall art \u201craises anew the question of the evolutionary and adaptive significance of graphic representation and its role in the successful dispersal of modern human populations out of Africa into Western Eurasia and beyond.\u201d It may also be part of an important artistic legacy: Just 6 miles away lies the astonishing Lascaux cave complex, where people\u2014the descendants, perhaps, of Abri Castanet\u2019s artists\u2014masterfully painted animals, human figures and abstract symbols 17,000 years ago.","author":"Jennie  Cohen","web_category":"news","title":"Prehistoric French Artistes Painted Earliest Wall Art","picture_url":"http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/wall-art.jpg","url":"http://www.history.com/news/prehistoric-french-artistes-painted-earliest-wall-art"}
