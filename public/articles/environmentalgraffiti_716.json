Yes, these humble crustaceans with the funny walking style make beautiful pictures out of sand. We\u2019ve all seen them. Time to inspect how and why of this mysterious art works. \nCrabs can be found in all the oceans around the world and one particular family, namely the sand bubbler crab (Dotilla fenestrate), are especially familiar because most of us will have admired their intricate artworks made out of little sand balls at a visit to the beach.\nIt's a horse!

They do this by collecting and sifting the sand, actually checking each grain, and rolling those parts devoid of anything useful for them into little balls (sand bubbles) that they toss behind. \nA close-up of the \"sand bubbles\", here in Myanmar:Photo: \nImage via China malcontent\nSo, the little sand balls are actually cleaned parts of sand, rolled into a ball so that the crab doesn\u2019t check them again by mistake. Pretty clever, isn\u2019t it? \nCombing the whole beach, grain by grain, in Sabah, Malaysia. Did anyone say Sisyphus?

Here\u2019s an awesome video of a sand bubbler crab rolling sand balls at a beach in Thailand. It starts slow but the action picks up after about one and a half minutes when the sand ball production gets going. A must-watch on stressful days!\nSo the next time you stumble upon cool designs by crab artists, quickly get your camera as come the next tide, they will be washed away forever. \nSources: 1, 2, 3\nIf you want to find out all the latest news on the environment, why not subscribe to our RSS feed?
