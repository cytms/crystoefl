And they\u2019ve done it again.\nIn order to bring something fresh and new into an overdeveloped industry, one interactive content provider from Tokyo has designed ringtones that only dogs can hear.\nDwango officials say their release is groundbreaking, but to some (myself included) it is absolutely useless. If somebody uses this ringtone, will they have to look at their dog barking insanely? What if the dog is equally annoyed by ringtones as I am?
