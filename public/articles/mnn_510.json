Anderson, of Environmental Allergy Assays, told Reuters Health. \"We know what the counts actually are, and saw the predicted counts often seemed to be different than what we were actually finding, so we were curious to see if there was much of a difference.\"\n?\nDr. Anderson and colleagues compared pollen levels, top-3 pollen lists, total counts and indices from 13 NAB stations \u2014 12 in the U.S. and one in Canada \u2014 with corresponding daily reports from www.pollen.com and www.theweathernetwork.com for the 2007 and 2009 pollen seasons.\n?\nThey found that pollen counts reported on these websites and the actual pollen counts derived from the NAB stations did not match up most of the time.\n?\nDuring allergy seasons, AAAI stations around the country make daily measurements of pollen and molds by sampling the air.\n?\nPredicted counts reported on many websites may be based on pollen data from previous years and general weather forecasts, Dr. Anderson said. For the \"real deal\" people with seasonal allergies should get their information from the NAB, he said.\n?\n\"We know that our pollen counts are based on actual counts that reflect the real day-to-day weather events,\" Dr. Anderson said. \"Relying on other, less trustworthy sites may cause hay fever sufferers to limit the time they spend outdoors doing activities they enjoy when it is really not necessary, or else doing the opposite and exposing themselves to higher levels and exacerbating their symptoms.\n?\nCopyright 2011?
