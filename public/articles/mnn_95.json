They will be up against academic powerhouses such as Stanford University, but their entry into this competition, hosted by the?U.S. Department of Energy, has not come without a price.\n?\nThe students\u2019 desire to bring a slice of Appalachia to the \u201cSolar Decathlon\u201d by building a solar-powered log cabin was initially met with resistance from their faculty adviser.\n?\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like it. Really, I didn\u2019t want them to do that,\u201d said Dimitris Korakakis, an associate professor of engineering at WVU. \u201cBut this is their project. Eventually, they showed me that they could make it work, and now I think it will work to our advantage.\u201d\n?\nKorakakis says a log cabin possesses inherent qualities that make it a poor choice for a design that must be energy and cost efficient. But the team recognized this fact before he had to intervene; they surprised him with a revamped design.\n?\n\u201cThey were determined to make it work,\u201d Korakakis says. \u201cSo they kept the log cabin, but they worked hard to make these changes that would make it function just like a normal, modern house, and I\u2019m pleased with the results.\u201d\n?\nWVU\u2019s team members?are proud of their decision to build a log cabin, a first in the decathlon\u2019s history.\u201dWe are from West Virginia, we are proud of that fact, and giving [the house] that log cabin feel is really going to separate us from our competitors,\u201d Bezares says.\n?\nThe log cabin design excels in another area: its down-home aesthetics.\n?\n\u201cWhen you go to the competition, a lot of the houses are really cool\u2026but they\u2019re not very homey,\u201d says Bellanca. \u201cOur idea was, let\u2019s have a house that captures the Appalachian spirit, so it has a real homey feel.\u201d\n?\nTo make the house more energy efficient, the team says that the log cabin design will stand as a purely visual component of the overall build. The inside of the house, the insulation and all the major accommodations will be on par with any modern house in the decathlon.\n?\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to adapt and to improvise,\u201d says Branden Bellanca, the leader of the WVU team.\n?\nWVU is also working from another disadvantage; there is no architectural school on campus they can tap for advice. Instead, the team enlisted the help of the?University of Rome Tor Vergata?in Italy as well as three local architectural companies.\n?\n\u201cWith their help, this house can actually go up,\u201d Bellanca says.\n?\nStudents on WVU\u2019s decathlon team see their chance to enter the competition as a great opportunity to reshape their school\u2019s \u201cparty first, study second\u201d image.\n?\n\u201cI think a lot of people kind of see West Virginia University a certain way,\u201d says Cecilio Bezares, a senior engineering student and member of the university\u2019s team. \u201cI think [the competition] is really going to help us step outside that box and really say, \u2018Hey, West Virginia University does have a great college in its engineering program, and it does have other great colleges.\u201d\n?\n\n\n?\nThe WVU team faces another challenge as well: how to deliver and assemble their finished product in Irvine, California, where the judging will take place in October 2013.\n?\n\u201cWe will have 11 days to make sure everything is right, that everything is set,\u201d Bezares says. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously worried about transportation. There\u2019s just a lot that can go wrong there.\u201d\n?\nAfter the judging, the WVU team will bring the house back to Morgantown and reconstruct it on campus. The future location of the house is undetermined at this time, but a permanent location should be finalized in the upcoming months.\n?\nIn the meantime, team is looking forward to the competition.\n?\n\u201cI think we have just as much of a chance as anyone else out there,\u201d Bezares says. \u201cWhen it comes to the ideas we have for our house, I think we will set ourselves apart.\u201d\n?\nRelated stories on MNN:\n2012 Solar Decathlon Europe: And the winner is ...\nSolar Decathlon: A sneak peek at the houses\nHere's how passive solar energy works\nThis story?was reported for the?Mountaineer News Service of West Virginia University.
